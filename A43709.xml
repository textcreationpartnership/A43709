            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HOw needfull it is to have a right belief of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> appears not only from the <hi>Ancient Creeds,</hi> which in how few words ſoever comprehended did alway make mention of Him; but alſo from the wretched <hi>Socinians,</hi> who blaſphemouſly denying his not onely <hi>Deity,</hi> but alſo <hi>Perſonality,</hi> and in their <hi>Catechiſm</hi> roundly aſſerting the no-neceſsity of any operation of his in order to our aſſenting to the Goſpel, have been ſo filled with a Spirit of Deluſion, that they retain not truth enough to denominate them either Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or Hereticks. The text upon which the enſuing diſcourſe is founded, afforded very fair opportunity of proving the Perſonality and Deity of this bleſſed Spirit, and of ſhewing that our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb facs="tcp:52563:3"/> corruption cannot be cured but by his inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation. But contenting my ſelf to wave, or ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to touch theſe matters, I mainly inſiſt on our <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this Spirit ſealed to the day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> a phraſe which (as moſt others that are metaphorical) hath had the hap to be many ways interpreted. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who ſeems to have read holy writ onely to ſerve a deſign, applies it to that indeleble character ſuppoſed by the Romaniſts to be imprinted on all that are baptized; but how vainly, appeareth</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> By his own <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Sacramenta imprimere characterem ex ſcriptura non habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ſed ex Eccleſiae authoritate, &amp; non multum antiquâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> By the miſerable ſhift he is put to, before he can find any imaginable foundation for this <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera</hi> in the words; He is fain to read with the vulgar Latine <hi>in the day,</hi> though againſt the Greek and Syriack; yea, and againſt ſundry latine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript copies, as <hi>Eſtius</hi> tells us: yet this very writer, <hi>Epheſ. 1.13.</hi> when he thought it would be more for his turn, forſaking the vulgar Latine which readeth in <hi>whom believing,</hi> flyeth to the Greek, <hi>after ye believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Beſides, how abſurd is it, that any indeleble character or cognizance of Chriſtianity ſhould be imprinted on all in Baptiſme, when as we ſee that
<pb facs="tcp:52563:3"/> many after Baptiſme do utterly and maliciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Baptiſme, and all the Principles of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
            <p>Other Pontifician writers, do refer the phraſe not to the Sacrament of Baptiſme, but Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So <hi>Eſtius;</hi> ſo our Country-men the Rhemiſts, who have this note on <hi>Epheſ. 1.13. Some refer this to the grace of Baptiſme; but to many learned it ſeemeth, that the Apoſtle alludeth to the giving of the Holy Ghoſt in the Sacrament of Confirmation, by ſigning the Baptized with the ſign of the Croſs and holy Chriſme.</hi> But they are well told by the judicious <hi>Dr.</hi> Fulk, <hi>That rhe learned men they ſpeak of muſt needs be Maſters of the new learning, for the ancient learning had no ſuch interpretation, inſtancing in</hi> Chryſoſtome, Ambroſe, Theodoret, Auguſtine, Primaſius, Hierome, Oecumenius, Theophylact, <hi>who carry the text quite another way.</hi> All Proteſtant Writers are not agreed what may be intended by this <hi>Sealing of the Spirit:</hi> (ſure it is for our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit that we can allow our ſelves to differ one from another in expounding a place of Scripture.) I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it not to the Holy Ghoſts regenerating or renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, but to his aſſuring us of the adoption of ſons, his creating in us a ſenſe of Gods Paternal love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, and of our filial love towards him: in ſo doing, I follow not onely ſundry learned ſons of
<pb facs="tcp:52563:4"/> our own Church, but alſo <hi>Cornelius a Lapide,</hi> whoſe comment on <hi>Epheſ. 1.13.</hi> being tranſlated is this, <q>As by the impreſsion of a Seal, the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Kings and publick tables are ſealed, that thoſe which are authentick may be diſtinguiſhed from doubtful; thoſe that are genuine from falſe, and it may be certainly manifeſt, that theſe are the Letters and Tables of the King. So ye Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Epheſians, as it were <hi>The Epiſtle of Chriſt, written not with ink, but the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of ſtone, but in the fleſhly tables of your heart,</hi> are ſigned with the Holy Ghoſt as it were with a Seal, that it may be manifeſted that ye are the not feigned, but au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Epiſtle of Chriſt, that ye are truly the people and Church of the true and high God.</q> Having thus deſcanted on the text he frames a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf this objection, <q>If this be ſo, then may Believers be certain that they are in the true faith and grace of God;</q> and for anſwer, denieth, the conſequence, <q>becauſe this Seal is not altogether and phyſically certain and evident to them, (for who certainly knows, who dares ſwear that he is ſealed with the Holy Ghoſt as with a ſeal) but onely probable, and morally, as it were, certain from ſigns and conjectures; ſo in like manner it is not to them clear and certain that they are in the true faith and grace of God.</q> For the further
<pb facs="tcp:52563:4"/> clearing of this doubt, He refers us to what he had ſaid on <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. Conſulting him on that place, I find him to give this note: <q>That the teſtimony of the Spirit by which he witneſſeth that we are the ſons of God, is not certain with certainty of Faith, nor certain with infallible certainty, as <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> and <hi>Cajetan</hi> would have it, but onely with a conjectural certainty, which certainty yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth with Holineſs: ſo that <hi>Vega,</hi> and <hi>Ruard,</hi> and <hi>Pererius,</hi> following them, think, that ſome men very holy, without the ſpecial revelation of God, from the ſigns and effects of the Holy Ghoſt, which they find in themſelves very frequent, clear and efficacious, have a certainty, not indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſo as they dare ſwear that they are in the grace of God, but yet ſuch and ſo great as excludes all fear of the contrary, not onely from the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and confidence, but alſo from the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and perſwaſion, ſo as ſuch do as certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know and believe that they are in the grace of God, as we certainly know and believe that there is ſuch a place as <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> or <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Let the <hi>Papiſts</hi> read this, and, if they have not loſt all ingenuity, acknowledge that ſome eminent Writers of their own go as high or higher then we do: For we do not ſay, that we are certain with a certainty of faith, that we are ſanctified or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; or if any do ſo ſay, it is onely a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
<pb facs="tcp:52563:5"/> miſtake; for they do not intend, that it is to any one revealed by any vocal or written teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that he is ſanctified or pardoned, but onely that ſeeing theſe Concluſions do ariſe from Premiſes, the one whereof is Scripture, though the other be known onely by inward ſenſe, therefore the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion may be of Faith; ſo that they make ſuch Concluſions to be of faith, not immediately, but onely by conſequence, and that on ſuppoſition, <hi>That a Propoſition certain from inward ſenſe, is ſtronger then a Propoſition certain from Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation,</hi> which is not univerſally true: Nor yet do we ſay; that this teſtimony of the Spirit doth make us infallibly certain; onely we ſay; that it makes thoſe who keep Conſciences void of offence, and are zealous of good works, have ſuch a certainty as is not mixed with any actual tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting doubt or fear, ſo as they can, their hearts not accuſing them, nor having any ground to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them of preſumption, call God Father, and Chriſt their elder Brother, and the Spirit their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate: Yet after all this they will not ſwear that they are the children of God; or if they ſhould, they would thereby do an act ſufficient to darken all the evidence they before had of their Adoption; for no one hath power to require ſuch an Oath, nor can any controverſie be ended by ſuch an Oath, which could not be ended without it; otherwiſe we do
<pb facs="tcp:52563:5"/> ſwear in ſundry matters in the which we have not a greater or ſo great an evidence as it is poſsible for a man to have of his Adoption. And in all Churches there is either from the Parents or other Sureties required, as oft as Children are baptized, an abrenunciation of the World, Fleſh, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and when the baptized children come to be adult, and receive Confirmation, 'tis required of them, that they profeſs before the Biſhops and all the Congregation preſent, <q>That they do renew the ſolemn Promiſe and Vow that was made in their name at Baptiſme, ratifying and confirming the ſame in their own perſons, and acknowledging themſelves bound to believe and to do all thoſe things which their Godfathers and Godmothers then undertook for them.</q>

            </p>
            <p>Now if ſo be perſons could not be ſatisfied that they are ſincere in their reſolutions, we ſhould by calling them to make ſuch Vows, but teach them to diſſemble and play the hypocrites.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But do not ſome of our Divines ſpeak of an immediate teſtimony of the Spirit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They do: But it is to be hoped that they mean no more then that the ſoul is ſometimes more then uſually meet to receive the Seal of the Spirit, more then ordinarily diſpoſed to give in its witneſs with the witneſs of the Spirit of God, <hi>i. e,</hi> ſometimes
<pb facs="tcp:52563:6"/> it hath ſo abaſed it ſelf before God, or done acts ſo apparently tending to Gods glory, ſo manifeſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to fleſh and blood, that it cannot upon the leaſt reflection but diſcern the well-pleaſingneſs of ſuch actions unto God, and conſequently take comfort in them. If they intend more then this by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate teſtimony, they muſt not blame others, if they ſay they underſtand them not, or that they fear they underſtand not themſelves. Should any one hear a voice ſaying to him, <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven;</hi> yea, ſhould he not onely hear ſuch a voice, but alſo ſee ſome glorious creature uttering that ſound, this would be an extraordinary teſtimony; but before a man either could or ought to receive it, and take comfort from it, he muſt firſt have ſome rational e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence that the apparition or voice is from God and not from Satan, who both can and frequently hath appeared and ſpoken not as from himſelf, but from God. We have in Scripture an example of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> puniſhed becauſe <hi>he did not believe the words of Gods Angel, Luk.</hi> 1.20. there being ſufficient evidence that he was an Angel of God, and nothing in the Meſſage that ſhould render it incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But we have alſo an Example of a Prophet more ſeverely puniſhed for believing one that pretended a Meſſage from God, whoſe Meſſage had every thing in it that might make it unlike to be from God. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 13.18, 22, 23. Wherefore to every young
<pb facs="tcp:52563:6"/> Convert, who not patient to wait for his Aſſurance in a way of ſelf-reflection and communing with his own heart, looks for any thing like a vocal teſtimony, I may ſay as did <hi>Gregory</hi> to <hi>Gregoria,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. How the Spirit can be ſaid to be grieved? for ſeeing he is God, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely perfect, how can we conceive him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52563:10"/> capable of grief, which is not onely a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but alſo of all paſſions the meaneſt, and loweſt, as ariſing from the ſenſe of ſome preſent evil which we cannot maſter? And this objection is the more conſiderable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the emphaticalneſs of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

            <p>But all this notwithſtanding, we may give a very fair account of the phraſe; for,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There are, who by the ſpirit of God do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the renewed part of man;</hi> and indeed it is not unuſual in Scripture for God to call his own work by his own name; now the renewed ſoul, whether our own, or others, is capable of being vexed in a proper ſenſe: but this ſenſe ſeems not here intended; yet this I muſt tell you, that God interprets all that is done againſt his children, as done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf; and therefore do you beware how you grieve the Lords holy ones, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſaying, or doing any thing, which you know their ſouls cannot but abhor: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it grieveth not ſome of your ſouls, nor grateth on ſome of your ears, to hear the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52563:11"/> name of God taken in vain, or blaſphemed, or the good ways of God ſpoken againſt; but true Believers are of another temper, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.10. <hi>As with a ſword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me, While they ſay day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto me, where is thy God.</hi> 2 Pet. 2.8. Lot <hi>vexed his righteous ſoul from day to day with the unlawful deeds which he ſaw and heard in Sodom and Gomorrah.</hi> Wherefore Sirs, be not am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious to ſtrike father and ſons at one blow; let it ſuffice that you diſhonour God, but do not diſhonour him at ſuch times and places, when and where his Saints may ſtand by, and ſee and hear the wrong and diſhonour that is reflected on their heavenly Father.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We may be ſaid to grieve him, when we do that which would grieve him were he ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of grief.</hi> The Scripture calls not things according to ſucceſs, and event; <hi>he that looks on a woman to luſt after her, hath committed adultery in his heart,</hi> though he never act that brutiſh luſt, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.28. <hi>He that hateth his brother is a Murtherer,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.15. not that every one that hateth doth properly kill; but that he who hateth his brother, had undoubtedly killed his brother, could his brother have been thought to death; his hatred would have brought forth murder,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52563:11"/> had not ſomething ſtrangled it in the womb, So we do by the Spirit; we do that againſt him, which would grieve him, and more then grieve him, were he capable of being grieved or any way altered for the worſe. O man! take it from me, <hi>every time thou ſinneſt preſumptuouſly, thou doſt what in thee lieth to annihilate the fountain of all eſſences; thou dost what thou canſt to leave the world without a God.</hi> He will be in heaven maugre all the malice of men and devils, no thanks to them; were he capable of being deprived of life, they by their ſins had deprived him of life long ſince. Hence he complains, that he was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces by the whoriſh heart of <hi>Iſrael, Ezek.</hi> 6.9. So true is that of the Schoolmen, that <hi>omne peccatum,</hi> is, <hi>deicidium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>We are ſaid to grieve the Spirit of God, when we make the Spirit of God ſo to carry it towards us, as perſons do towards thoſe that have grieved them.</hi> If by any unworthy carriage I have vexed my friend, he intermits all acts of friendſhip and familiarity; So doth the Spirit, when any thing is committed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his nature or offices, withdraw his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne influences and conſolations, which are better then life. I judge as do the generality of Reformed Divines, <hi>that the Spirit of God
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52563:12"/> doth never forſake thoſe totally whom hee hath once choſen for his temple.</hi> 
               <q>In this we know we are not deceived, nor can we deceive you, when wee teach, that the faith where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by yee are ſanctified cannot fail, it did not in the Prophet, it ſhall not in you. They which are born of God do not ſin any ſuch ſin as doth quite extinguiſh grace, clean cut them off from Chriſt Jeſus: becauſe the ſeed of God abideth in them, and doth ſhield them from receiving any irremediable wound ſaith the judicious M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> Sermon of the Certainty, <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 545, 546.</q> But <hi>de non exiſtentibus et non apparentibus eadem eſt ratio,</hi> the Spirit may, when greived, ſo dwell in a man, as if he did not dwell in him; he may be quite gone, as to any preſent ſenſe and feeling: he was ſo as to David, which made him pray, <hi>Create in me a clean heart, and renew a right ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>Why are we rather ſaid to greive the Holy Ghoſt, then the Father, or the Son?</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>Queſt. 3. <hi>What are the ſpecial ſinnes by which we do more eminently grieve the Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the queſtion were put concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the general nature of the ſins by which the Spirit is grieved, ſoon might it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52563:13"/> for it ſeems to be paſt all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, that we grieve him not by ſins of day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incurſion, not by meer unavoideable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, ſuch as by the meaſure of grace vouchſafed on this ſide heaven we cannot eſcape; but by ſins that are in ſome degree deliberate and wilfull: but ſeeing it is put, concerning the ſpecial kinds of deliberate ſins which are moſt grievous to the Spirit, it will deſerve a larger anſwer.

               </gap> but: as for the cauſe, <hi>in which is exceſs,</hi> its not to be taken for exceſs in drinking, for then the ſence would be a little incommodious, Be not you drunk with wine, in which being drunk with wine,<note place="margin">Vid.

Therefore every filthy obſcene word, yea, and every unclean thought, if moroſe, muſt needs be grievous to the Spirit, whoſe dwelling in Saints makes them to be Saints.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſins of <hi>Anger, Malice, Bitterneſſe,</hi> and which <hi>flow</hi> thence, <hi>Strife,</hi> and <hi>Diviſions:</hi> Theſe are commonly numbred among ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſins; but I am ſure that the Apoſtle doth reckon <hi>hatred, variance, ſtrife, ſeditions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings,</hi> among the fruits of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.20, 21. and that he doth call the <hi>Corinthians</hi> carnal, becauſe there was among them, <hi>envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>ſtrife,</hi> and <hi>diviſions; one ſaying he was of</hi> Paul, <hi>another he was of</hi> Apollos, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3, 4. 'Tis thought by ſome, that the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> did not make <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> the Heads of their Parties and Factions, but that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth by a Figure transferr this unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and <hi>Apollos,</hi> that they might collect, that if
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52563:15"/> it were ſo fooliſh and carnal to glory in them endued with extraordinary gifts, it was much more fooliſh to glory in thoſe ordinary Paſtors by whoſe names they did call and diſtinguiſh themſelves: How carnal is it then for one to ſay, I am of <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> and another, I am of <hi>des Cartes?</hi> In reference to which parties I need not ſay, Was <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> crucified for you? Were you baptized into the name <hi>Cartes?</hi> but, doth there in either of their Writings occurr ſo much as the name of Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Certainly, ſo to admire the Tenents ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the one or the other, as to vilifie and deny the parts of thoſe who cloſe not with them, is very unbeſeeming any that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to be led by the Spirit. But let us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe ſins to be called ſpiritual, as in a ſenſe they may, that makes them onely <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noris ſcandali,</hi> leſs ſcandalous, not <hi>Minoris malitiae,</hi> leſs wicked; if uncleanneſs and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs make a man like a beaſt, theſe make him like a Devil: If, as the School-men ſay, that in ſome creatures there be the foot-ſteps, but in others the image of God, ſo we may be allowed to think that in ſome ſins be to be found not onely the foot-ſteps but alſo the image of the Devil, 'tis as much in theſe ſins as in any other; <hi>Be angry and ſin not, let not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52563:15"/> the Sun go down on your wrath, neither give place to the Devil,</hi> Epheſ. 4.25, 26. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the words implieth, that ſo much place as we give to Anger, ſo much place we give to the Devil. To be ſure, theſe ſins are ſo contrary to love, which though it be not as <hi>Lombard</hi> thought, the eſſence of the Holy Ghoſt, yet is one of his chiefeſt fruits, that they muſt needs hugely grieve him. If a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious woman be a continual dropping in a very rainy day; and if any wiſe man would chooſe rather to dwell in the wilderneſs, then with a contentious and angry woman; how can the Spirit think you delight to dwell with thoſe Salamanders that are never well but in the fire of contention, and count themſelves not to be in their element any longer then they are wrangling, and diſputing perverſly about ſubſtantial forms and qualities, or about matter, motion, and atomes?</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52563:17"/> the Lords day. And is it not too evident, that Students flock in greater companies to an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or Philoſophy-Lecture in the Schools, then to the reading or preaching of the divine Oracles in the Churches? Alas! do Angels vouchſafe you their preſence in humanity Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures? do they delight themſelves in Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical ſpeculations? Why they are preſent at Chriſtian aſſemblies, and deſire to pry into the myſteries of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. Is Philoſophy become the power of God unto Salvation? or is that which to <hi>David was ſweeter then the hony, and the hony comb,</hi> become now like the white of an egge in the which there is no favour? Did <hi>Luther</hi> ſay, that he cared not if his own books were burned, leſt they ſhould hinder men from reading Scriptures? and can we find in our hearts to let the Bible lie by us unread, unſtudied? Sure it muſt needs grieve the Spirit, to ſee the <hi>miniſtration of the ſpirit</hi> thus undervalued; the doctrine according to godlineſs, which is profitable for all things, as much diſregarded as if it were profitable for nothing. <hi>Hierome</hi> tells us, how an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel came and cuffed him, ſo as he felt the blows ſome time after, becauſe he did ſo much dote on <hi>Tully;</hi> and that he was told, <hi>Non es

            <p n="4">4. The robbing the Spirit of his glory, and taking unto our ſelves the praiſe of what we are, have, or do. When <hi>Virgil</hi> had made an excellent Copy of verſes, and a paltry fellow had given out himſelf to be Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them, grief and indignation made him thus to verſifie,
<q>
                  <l>Hos ego verſiculos feci tulit alter honores</l>
                  <l>Sic vos non vobis,</l>
                  <l>Sic vos non vobis, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Why, whether they be gifts, or admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, or operations they are all wrought in us by the Spirit: if we inſtead of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:52563:18"/> this, be ſo arrogant as to ſay, Are not theſe the gifts that we have acquired, theſe the graces that we have wrought in our ſelves, theſe the good duties that we have done? we commit ſuch a piece of Robbery, as God will moſt certainly puniſh, either by recovering his lent gifts, or by permitting us to fall into ſome ſoul ſin: our evil works for which we are humble, do not do us ſo much miſchief, as do our good works of which we boaſt; and if God love us, he will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let us fall into ſome foul enormity, then not cure us of the ſin of pride, then which there's not a ſin in his eyes more loathſome. Leſt any ſhould be offended at ſuch language, I judg here convenient to fortifie my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt prejudice, by quoting Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and in him St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> writing to the ſame purpoſe:<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Pride.</note> 
               <q>What is Virtue but a medicine? and Vice, but a wound? yet have we ſo often deeply wounded our ſelves with medicine, that God hath been fain to make wounds medicinable; to cure by vice, where vertue hath ſtricken; to ſuffer the juſt man to fall, that being raiſed, he may be taught what power it was that upheld him ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I am not afraid to affirme it boldly
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52563:18"/> with St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that men puffed up through a proud opinion of their own ſanctity and holineſs, receive a benefit at the hands of God, and are aſſiſted with his grace, when with his grace they are not aſſiſted, but permitted, and that grievouſly, to tranſgreſs; whereby as they were in over great liking of themſelves ſupplanted, ſo the diſlike of that which did ſupplant them, may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh them afterwards the ſurer. Aske the very ſoul of <hi>Peter,</hi> and it ſhall undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly make you it ſelf this anſwer; My eager proteſtations made in the glory of my Ghoſtly ſtrength, I am aſhamed of; but thoſe chryſtal tears wherewith my ſin and weakneſs was bewailed, have procured my endleſs joy; my ſtrength hath been my ruine, and my fall my ſtay.</q> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be permitted, to deny his Maſter, then to retain too high an opinion of grace recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: <hi>Deteſtabilis eſt cordis humani ſuperbia quâ facit homo quod Deus in hominibus damnat, ſed illa deteſtabilior quâ ſibi tribuit homo quod Deus donat hominibus. Tanto enim deterioris ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbiae tenetur reus, quanto in melioribus donis exiſtit ingratus.</hi> Deteſtable is that pride, which makes a man do that which God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns in man; but more deteſtable is that,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52563:19"/> which cauſeth man to attribute that to himſelf which God gives to men. A man is guilty of ſo much the worſe pride, by how much the gifts are better for which he is unthankfull. Surely God will deal with theſe men as did our King with him who ventured hard to fetch up the crown that was fallen into the waters, and when he had ſo done, put it on his own head; he had a talent for his pains, but loſt his life for ſetting it upon any head but his Soveraignes: ſo they ſhall have honour for contending for the truth, but their ſouls ſhall God require of them, becauſe, they gave not him the glory of all their zeal. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as you would not grieve the Spirit, when you ſee a drunkard, ſay, <hi>Who made me to differ;</hi> or ſay as the Holy Martyr <hi>Bradford</hi> was wont to ſay, God be mercifull to me a miſerable ſinner. When you hear of one denying the Divinity of our Saviour, ſay, Nor could I have ſaid that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Spirit of God. If either men or devil ſuggeſt that thou haſt done well, ſay, It was not I, but the grace of God in me; I have nothing but what I have received, and muſt not boaſt as if I had not received, but aſcribe all to him who worketh in me both to will and do of his own good pleaſure.</p>

How much was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Solomons</hi> time grieved when her living child was taken away, and a dead one laid in room of it? More muſt the Spirit be grieved, when Humility, Obedience, Subjection to higher powers, his natural iſſue, are taken away; and inſtead of theſe, diſobedience and rebellion laid at his door. To do wickedly, and to ſay that we do it by the impulſe of the Spirit, is to make God ſuch a one as our ſelves; and what a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation that is, you may learn from <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.21. Theſe things haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence, thou thoughteſt I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf; but I will reprove thee, and ſet thy ſins in order before thee. Nor ſhall they fare better, who do not father their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties on the immediate impulſes of the Spirit, but yet on the Word revealed by the Spirit. For <hi>cauſa cauſae, eſt cauſa cauſati;</hi> whatever is found in Scripture, is conceived of the Holy Ghoſt: if we do wreſt and torture Scripture to ſalve our <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> we do thereby injure, and lie againſt the Holy Ghoſt. This is the honour of Chriſtian Religion, that it can wound all other religions with their own weapons and principles. They rob it of this honor, who go about to fight
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52563:20"/> againſt is alſo with its own Sword, quoting texts of Scripture to authorize ſuch actions as are perfectly deſtructive of Chriſtianity. No ſin ſo hainous as theirs who pretend to ſinne by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The aſcribing that to the devil and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, which is the work of the Spirit. This is not onely to grieve him, but alſo to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him. What was the unpardonable blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt mentioned <hi>Mark</hi> 3. but the Phariſees aſcribing that to the Prince of Devils, which was done by the finger of God? Every work of the Spirit hath not ſo clear an impreſſion of the Spirit on it, as had the miracles of Chriſt; and therefore to miſ-call them renders not ones caſe ſo deſperate as was the Phariſees: But yet ſure, after God hath by the converſion of ſo many, diſcovered himſelf to be in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel, of a truth, for any to ſay that they were all literal, legal, antichriſtian, which was the language of the late times, was a blaſphemy of a very high nature; and I have obſerved, that ſuch men moſtly have waxed worſe and worſe, deceiving and being deceived: nor can <hi>I</hi> conceive much hopes of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who do ſo far wrong the Spirit, as to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe all his works of conviction and contrition, to the predominance of the melancholy humor,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52563:20"/> or to a cracked brain; and all the fervent impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate expoſtulations of Gods devouteſt ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, to ſaucineſs, ſuch ſpeeches do greatly diſpoſe tot he unpardonable ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>We may hence inferr againſt the <note n="*" place="margin">I ſay, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>daizing <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> becauſe this ſeemeth to have been the opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Holy Ghoſt was nothing but the <hi>afflatus</hi> or energy of God; and therefore <hi>Lactantius,</hi> who denied the ſubſtantiality of the Spirit, is ſaid by <hi>Hierome</hi> to ſymbolize with <hi>Jews,</hi> Epiſt. <hi>55.</hi> Yet the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Doctors of the <hi>Jews</hi> acknowledged and believed the Son to be an eternal perſon of the Divine eſſence, and worthy to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as they who want other books may ſee proved by <hi>Julius Conradus Ouho; lib. 1. Gul. Razia, cap. 4.</hi>
               </note> Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing <hi>Socinian,</hi> the perſonality of the Holy Ghoſt. Grief is a perſonal affection. How a perſon ſhould be grieved, we can underſtand; how a Divine perſon ſhould have that done againſt him, which would grieve him, were he capable of griefe, is not inexplicable: but how a quality, a power, or an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, ſhould be grieved is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence may be inferred, the love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der care the Spirit hath for us, and of us. Had he not graciouſly condeſcended to take on him the offices of Advocate, Interceſſor, Comforter, he would not have ſo far concerned himſelf in our miſcarriages, as to be grieved for, or by them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:52563:21"/>3. If we are not to grieve the Spirit, then ſure we are not to blaſpheme or offer deſpight unto him; which cannot be done, but by ſinnes of the greateſt, and moſt helliſh malignity, and in the higheſt degree wilfull.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This will alſo inform us, what to think of them who take up their pleaſures in ſin, which grieves the Holy Spirit of God; we may think, that either they never were partakers of the Holy Ghoſt; or if ever partakers, that now he hath quite forſaken them, and an evil Spirit from the Lord hath ſeiſed on them. If Chriſt at his ſecond coming would ſpare all other ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet doubtleſs he will <hi>damn</hi> all thoſe that believed not the truth, but had plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in unrighteouſneſſe, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.12.</p>
            <p>But the main I intend to dwell on, is the counſell of the Text; propounded indeed negatively, but yet muſt be ſuppoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in it many affirmative duties, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all by which that good Spirit can be pleaſed and delighted. I will firſt propound ſome motives to perſwade men to abſtain from all ſins by which the Spirit is grieved; they ſhall be drawn from the perſon and office of him whom they grieve, from their own eſtate who do grieve him, from the ſad and wofull effects of greiving him.</p>

               </gap>, make it all one as if a Dative did follow; beſides this, 'tis moſt certain, that ſometimes with an Accuſative it ſignifieth to deceive or cheat; and it muſt here ſo ſignifie, becauſe this ſin is called a tempting the Spirit of the Lord: How violent would it be to expound that phraſe by counterfeiting of the Spirit of the Lord? every time we grieve the Spirit of God, we grieve God: And is that a ſmall matter in our eyes? Can there be a greater aggravation of ſin? <hi>If one man ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, the judg ſhall judg him: but if a man ſin againſt the Lord, who ſhall intreat for
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52563:22"/> him,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. but this would alſo further be conſidered by us, that though there be no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as to the Eſſence of the Perſons, yet there is a difference in the oeconomy; he that grieveth the Spirit, grieveth that divine perſon againſt whom alone ſuch a ſin can be committed as is unpardonable: <hi>Whoſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall be forgiven him; but whoſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him, neither in this life, nor in that which is to come,</hi> Mat. 12.32. To ſin againſt Father or Son, is not ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, as to ſin againſt the Spirit; becauſe he acting not in his own name, but in the name of Father and Son, from both of whom he is ſent; to ſin againſt him, is to ſin againſt all the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of God, all the love of the Trinity, the loweſt condeſcention that divine goodneſs ever did, or can make.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Conſider we how little the Spirit hath deſerved to be thus grieved by us. <hi>Many good works</hi> (ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 10.32.) <hi>have I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you from my Father, for which of them do ye ſtone me?</hi> Many good works hath the Spirit from the Father and the Son done you, O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, for which of them do ye grieve him? Did I ſay many? I might have ſaid, all: there is no good gift that is either wrought in you, or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52563:23" rendition="simple:additions"/> for you, or by you, but it is to be aſcribed to this Spirit. Is Chriſt precious to you? he was conceived by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in the womb of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> he deſcended upon him in his Baptiſm, and anointed him to all his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, raiſed him from the dead, bears witneſs of him, and pleads his cauſe againſt the unbelieving ſinful world. Is there any ſweetneſs in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? why theſe are all from this Spirit: <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Are you taken with thoſe admirable gifts that you ſee in your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? <hi>All that diverſity of gifts is from the ſame Spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. called all therefore <hi>the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Spirit,</hi> verſ. 7. Or are you more affected with the works of God in you? they are all the fruits and effects of the Spirit, whether conviction, or contrition, or humiliation, or regeneration, or conſolation, they are all wrought by the Spirit; this is the argument made uſe of in the Text, <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God, by which ye are ſealed to the day of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> In calling him the holy Spirit of God, he meaneth not onely that he is of eſſential, origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, indefectible ſanctity; but alſo becauſe he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all the holineſs that is in any of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And when we are ſaid to be by him ſeaed
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52563:23"/> up unto the day of our redemption, by that phraſe is ſignified, that he doth all that which anſwereth to the nature and various ends and uſes of Sealing. But with that phraſe I am not to meddle as yet; nor liſt I to run over all his works, but pitch on that of comforting, and preſs that, to keep men from grieving him. The Spirit is <hi>the Comforter,</hi> ſent from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the prayer of his Son, to ſupply the abſence of his corporeal preſence, to open thoſe wells of Salvation, that were hid, and did lie under ground, in the days that the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> did dwell among men. In ſome Churches they have an officer who is called <hi>Conſolator Aegro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> whoſe work is to put the breſts of conſolation into the mouths of thoſe who have received within themſelves the ſentence of death: ſhould any, whilſt this Officer is at his bed-ſide labouring to take out the ſting of death, vex him with untoward language, and not to give over till he had forced him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part his room; would not all ſay that this man were either in a phrenſie, or elſe in the very gall and bitterneſs of ſpiritual death. The wickedneſs of thoſe who do grieve the Spirit of God is far greater. For</p>
            <p n="1">1. This ſick Comforter cannot alway be with thoſe whom he viſits, but is now diſcourſing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:52563:24" rendition="simple:additions"/> with them, and anon gone either to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther languiſhing perſon, or to his own relations. But the Spirit is a Comforter alway abiding with you, <hi>John</hi> 14.16. Not that he actually comforts at all times, but that he always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the root of comfort, alway tenders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, were not Chriſtians either ſo ſullen, or ſo ſtupid as not to receive it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Comforter of the ſick may endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to comfort, and not be able to comfort; Men may not be ſo wiſe as to open to him the root of their fears; or if they do, he may not be able to reach them; or if to reach them, not to pull them out; There are perplexities of conſcience which will puzzle and non-plus the moſt experienced Chriſtian or Teacher: But ſo ſtrong are the Conſolations of the Spirit, that they break through all oppoſition of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grief and trouble, whether ariſing from afflictions, or guilt of ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſick Comforter may apply comfort unſeaſonably, and nothing is more uſual then to loſe <hi>clave errante,</hi> to ſpeak peace where God ſpeaks no peace: but the conſolations of the Spirit, are never miſplaced or miſtimed; he pours not the oil of gladneſs but into broken hearts; he puts not the garments of praiſe upon any, but thoſe in whom hath been
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:52563:24"/> the Spirit of heavineſs; he applieth not his ſtrong conſolations to any, but the heirs of the Promiſe, nor to them neither, but onely when <hi>they fly for refuge, and lay hold of the hope that is ſet before them. Heb.</hi> 6.18, 19. When they flie, as men purſued by the Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of blood did to the Cities of refuge, or to the horns of the Altar.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In the abſence of the ſick Comforter, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may do the work as well perhaps as he: but the Spirit is ſo a Comforter, as none can comfort without him; all conſolation therefore is called the conſolation of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.31. Whileſt the Spirit of the Lord did reſt on <hi>Sampſon;</hi> he could break withs and cords; but the Spirit being departed, <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> may go out and ſhake himſelf, and think to do as at other times, but he ſhall ſoon find a difference; the Philiſtines ſhall prevail, lead him away captive, and put out his eyes. So thoſe who by the help of the Spirit have in former tribulations been made to rejoice and glorie, may think when aſſaulted afreſh to ſhew like chearfulneſs; but if by any ſin they have made the Spirit depart, they ſhall find a little thing too heavy to bear, the loſs of a child, which is but a common temptation ſhall make them cry, and take on, more like men then
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:52563:25"/> like Chriſtians; yea, more like children then men. Now, put all theſe conſiderations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and when corruption next ſtirs, ſay, What! ſhall I grieve my Comforter, my abiding, my ſtrong, my wiſe, my onely Comforter? This queſtion will ſtrangle it in the womb, if any ingenuity be left in the ſoul: if is be grown hard and carnal through the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, then nothing but arguments drawn from wrath will work on it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Let it be pondred, who they be that thus grieve the Spirit; all men are not in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city ſo to do; they that are, have of all men leaſt reaſon to do it. <hi>Amyraldus</hi> in his <hi>Theſes</hi> about the ſin againſt the Holy Spirit, hath well obſerved, that a man may be conſidered under a twofold <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or relation, one meerly natural or legall, having knowledg of duty, but no revelation of any mercy or pardon in caſe he ſin; he that in this caſe ſins, ſinneth rather againſt the Father, then againſt Son, or Holy Ghoſt; or elſe, he may be conſidered as under an evangelical diſpenſation; and that again two ways, either ſo as onely to have heard of remiſſion of ſins, but not at all to believe it, or be affected with it; he that ſins in this ſtate, ſins rather againſt the Son, then againſt the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:52563:25"/> Holy Ghoſt, or ſo as not onely to have ſeen the marvellous light of the Goſpel, but alſo to have been refreſhed with its beams, and made to rejoice in it; if in this ſtate he ſin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, he muſt needs grieve the Spirit; but thus to ſin, is to ſin at a very high rate, when a man hath been made partaker of the holy Ghoſt, and taſted of the powers of the world to come, and of the heavenly gift, the Spirit may ſay, What could I have done more to endear religion, and inodiate ſin, that I have not done? To grieve the Spirit after all this by returning to folly and vanity, is an affront and diſingenuity not to be ſuffered, and which ſhall be moſt ſeverely puniſhed, either in this world, or in the other, or in both. This leads to the Fourth Motive drawn, from the ſad effects and conſequents of grieving the Spirit. I will not ſay with <hi>Luther,</hi> that it may make God ro carry it towards men, <hi>tanquam ſi non eſſet Deus ipſorum, ſed Diabolus;</hi> nor dare I ſo much as adventure to Engliſh ſo harſh an expreſſion: but I ſhall direct to one place of Scripture, in which enough is ſaid to terrifie us from grieving the Spirit; <hi>They rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit, therefore he was turned to be their enemy, and he fought againſt them,</hi> (ſo far was he from aſſiſting them againſt
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:52563:26"/> their enemies) and he raiſed up enemies againſt them; and cauſed Rebels to fall before them God's puniſhments under the Goſpel are more ſpiritual, not leſs ſevere. As for the temporary beleever, the Spirit being grieved by him may ſo forſake him, as that the unclean Spirit may return with ſeven unclean ſpirits worſe then that which was caſt out; he may be ſuffred ſo to fall, as that it ſhall be impoſſible to renew him by repentance. As for ſuch as by the inhabitation of the Holy Ghoſt are conſecrated and made Temples of God, I am ſo ſtrongly perſwaded of the doctrine of perſeverance, that I do not think they ever again become of the Synagogue of Sathan, but their grieving of the Spirit may be ſo puniſhed, as that</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They may be permitted to fall into very foul and diſhonourable luſts.</hi> He that complieth with the motions of the Spirit, is changed into, the image of God from glory to glory, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news his ſtrength as doth the Eagle; but give me a man that grieves the Spirit, he ſhall in a ſhort time fall into abominable either opinions or practiſes: and when we do conſider how ugly have been the carriages, and how ſcandalous the Apoſtaſies of ſome that doubtleſs were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, and made the higheſt profeſſion of Religion, we cannot reſt in any other cauſe of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:52563:26" rendition="simple:additions"/> them, then Gods judiciall blinding and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, for vexing his Spirit of truth and holineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>All ordinances become unprofitable to them.</hi> Promiſes ſometimes ſweeter then the honey and the honey-comb, have no reliſh in them. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and threatnings, of which their hearts were wont to ſtand in awe, now affect them no more then dreadful tales of men in another world. Were it not for ſhame, had they but any hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom excuſe, they would not come at ordinances at all: the Diſciples are told, <hi>John</hi> 14.26. that the Spirit ſhall bring things to their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; by which I would not underſtand a bare calling them to mind, but a bringing them to mind in their full vigor, authority, evidence. 'Tis the Spirit alone that ſets home doctrines with demonſtration and power; the Spirit grieved, the moſt weighty truths are no more regarded then ſo many idle dreams, at leaſt no more then do <hi>the enticing words of mans wiſdom</hi> (unto which the demonſtration of the Spirit is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.4.) the probable diſcourſes of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and Philoſophers, which at the utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender but opinion, perhaps it is ſo, perhaps it is otherwiſe. Be it ſo, that <hi>the word of God is quick and powerful, and ſharper then any two edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:52563:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Soul and Spirit, of the joints and marrow, Heb.</hi> 4.12. yet is it thus vital and operative onely as it is <hi>the Sword of the Spirit, Epheſ.</hi> 6. out of his hand it will pierce no deeper then would the ſword of <hi>Gideon</hi> in the hand of an youth. Be it ſo that the miniſtration of the Goſpel is more then that of the Law, yet it's greater glory lies onely in this, that it is <hi>the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. The Spirit withdrawing himſelf, as it may well be thought he will do if grieved, even the Goſpel quickneth no more then the killing Letter did. <hi>Moſes put avail over his face, that the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>could not ſtedfaſtly look to the end of that which is aboliſhed: But their minds were blinded; for untill this day remaineth the ſame vail untaken away in the reading of the Old Teſtament.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13, 14 We think this vail is taken away in the Goſpel, and indeed it cannot be denied but that the Pen-men of the new Teſtament have uſed great plainneſs of ſpeech; but there is ſtill a vail on the hearts of men, and if the Spirit of the Lord do not take away that vail, (as if he be diſpleaſed, uſually he doth not) even the Goſpel may be hid as much as ever the Law was to the carnal <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Upon the grieving of the Spirit uſually follow ſad heart-diſtreſſing doubts and fears in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:52563:27"/> reference to our preſent and eternal condition. 'Tis the Spirits office to <hi>make us know the things that are freely given us of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.12, <hi>to witneſs to our Spirits that we are the Children of God, Rom.</hi> 8.15, 16. <hi>to ſhed abroad the love of God in our hearts,</hi> Rom. 5.5, he is <hi>the earneſt of our inheritance untill the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion, Eph.</hi> 1.14. If we grieve him, we are leſt in the dark, and ſee no light, and know not whether we go. And how ſad is this, to be at ſuch a loſs as to ſay, It may be I ſhall ſit down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Jacob;</hi> but it may alſo be, that I ſhall make my bed in Hell with the Devil and his Angels where there is weeping, wailing, gnaſhing of teeth? but upon our grieving of the Spirit we are, not onely left under doubts, but alſo under poſitive apprehenſions, that the wrath to come ſhall be our portion. How many have been heard to roar out, I am damned, I am damned? which crys, though they maybe acknowledged ſomtimes to proceed from Melancholy, or other bodily diſtemper, yet do they more frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the grieved Spirit's withdrawing of himſelf.</p>
            <p>You ſee, whether you are acted from ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or from fear, there's great reaſon you ſhould ceaſe from grieving the Spirit; and no leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52563:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> is there, why you ſhould not only not grieve him, but alſo rejoice and pleaſe him; the which you ſhall do, if,</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>You grieve when he is grieved,</hi> and vex your righteous ſouls at every thing that vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him. This is an act of friendſhip we all owe to all thoſe that are of the ſame body with us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.15, much more to him <hi>by whom we are all baptiſed into one body.</hi> 1 Cor. 12.13.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>If you bring forth all the fruits of the Spirit, i. e.</hi> all manner of holineſs, but more eſpecially thoſe mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22, 23. <hi>Love, joy, peace, long ſuffering, gentleneſs, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, faith, meekneſs, temperance.</hi> When we bring forth theſe, we not onely live in the Spirit, but walk in the Spirit; which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever do, <hi>fulfill not the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.26. <hi>are not deſirous of vain glory, provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, envying one another.</hi> And let it be obſerved, that the Apoſtle reckoning up the fruits of the Spirit, doth not inſtance in prayers and ſupplications, though they, when made with faith and humility, are undoubted evidences of the Spirits dwelling in us; but in meekneſs, gentleneſs, love, and ſuch other <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as are oppoſite to ſinfull paſſions; for by <hi>goodneſs</hi> we are to underſtand in this place, <hi>kindneſs, and friendlineſs,</hi> or a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:52563:28"/> on all occaſions to do good to others: And by <hi>Faith,</hi> not that which is called faith on our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; but <hi>fidelity or faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> towards men, oppoſed to treachery and inconſtancy. Believe it, to take all opportunities of doing our brethren good, to be punctual in performing our promiſes, patiently to bear all the injuries and provocations that are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred us by others, and ſtudying as much as in us lieth to preſerve peace with all men, are greater evidences that a man is ſpiritual, then are long prayers, or any thing of that nature, by which ſome of late have been ſo much puffed up. Believers have the Spirit in them, and they are ſaid to be in the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. As he that is born of the fleſh, is fleſh; ſo he that is born of the Spirit, is Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and therefore, as they who are in the fleſh, do in nothing pleaſe God, do in all times and places mind the things of the fleſh; ſo they that are in the Spirit, they ſhould do all things to pleaſe the Father, they ſhould ſpiritualize their very natural and civil actions, doing them unto the glory of God. So ſhall nature as it were be adopted into grace, and every meals meat become an holy and acceptable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p n="3">III. If we pray to him, and for him, and bleſs God
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:52563:29"/> for all the good things wrought in us by him. We ſhould <hi>pray to Him,</hi> elſe how do we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg his Deity? how do we ſtick to our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, in which we were baptiſed into his name? We ſhould <hi>pray for Him,</hi> elſe how do we look upon him as the great gift and promiſe of the new Covenant? We ſhould <hi>bleſs God for Him,</hi> or elſe how do we prize the benefits beſtowed on us, and wrought in us by him? Shall we bleſſe God for ſome ſingle good things, and not for the Spirit, who is every good thing, (as appears by comparing <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.11. with <hi>Luke.</hi> 11.13.) that were an high indignity offered to this divine perſon! That we may do all theſe the more enlargedly, it were good often to meditate how great a condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is in the Spirit, to dwell where he hath the Fleſh alway luſting againſt him; to help us in all our infirmities; to make interceſſion for us with groans that cannot be expreſſed, to apply unto us the redemption purchaſed, and make us meet for the inheritance of Saints in glory.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. If we honour his gifts in others, eſpecially thoſe which are beſtowed for the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. Tis the Holy Ghoſt which ſeparates men to the office of the Miniſtry; and when men are put into that Office, they do receive the Holy Ghoſt, therefore they ought to be
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:52563:29"/> honoured and had in eſteem, for their office and work ſake.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But doth not the anointing teach us all things, and ſo teach us as that we need not that man ſhould teach us at all?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> So indeed it is ſaid, and that by ſome pretending ſo much to the Spirit, as that their uſual compellation to others is <hi>Fleſh;</hi> but we are not to believe every ſpirit, but to try the ſpirits whether they be of God: and I heartily wiſh the ſpirit from whence this Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth, did not too manifeſtly diſcover it ſelf not to be of God.</p>
            <p>The Spirit that Chriſt promiſed, was to be ſent from the Father in the name of Chriſt, and was not to ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſoever he had heard, he was to receive of Chriſt, and glorifie Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 16.13.14. But the men who make this objection do diſhonour and decrey Chriſt, ſetting up Chriſt within them in oppoſition to him that ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> the Spirit inſpired Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Evangeliſts, to deliver down unto us a rule of faith and life; but theſe men do vilifie this written word, and miniſtration of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and call on their proſelytes to follow that light within them, and make that ſufficient for ſalvation. For my part I am ſo far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:52563:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> that any ſhould envy for our ſakes, that I could heartily wiſh that all the Lords people were prophets, and that his Spirit were on them. Were there a <hi>Seculum Spiritus</hi> to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I hope I ſhould as ſincerely pray for it, and as much rejoyce in the approaches of it, as ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther; but ſo farr am I form finding in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures any time in which the Miniſtry ſhall ceaſe, and be uſeleſs, that I rather find the Spirit is to be received by the <hi>hearing of faith,</hi> and that it is one great work of the Spirit, to quicken and give life to the publick Ordinances as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by the Miniſters of the Goſpel; 'tis the <hi>Holy Ghoſt that maketh them overſeers of the flock. Acts.</hi> 20.28. As for that place, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.29. it carrieth it's anſwer in its own bowels, <hi>You ſhall not need that any one teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you, (i. e.)</hi> not other things, nor in another way then the ſame anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting teacheth you; but do any miniſters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to teach other things, or in another way then this anointing teacheth? If they do not, as it is moſt certaine they do not, why is this Scripture ſo frequently urged againſt miniſterial teaching? For ever let us abhor thoſe who cry up the Spirit, ſo as to juſtle out that forme of found words which hath been delivered unto us by menguided by the Spirit; Be ſure you <hi>quench
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:52563:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> not the Spirit,</hi> but have a care you <hi>deſpiſe not prophecyings;</hi> God having put thoſe two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels together, let no man put them aſunder.</p>

               <p>THe old Interpreter reads, <hi>in</hi> the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and by it <hi>Oecumenius</hi> and ſome others underſtand the day of Baptiſme: but becauſe in the Greek tis not <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and we have no reaſon to think that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is put for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we ſhall by this day underſtand the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as moſt Interpreters do, and as we are led to do by that twin-place, Chap. 1 13.14. where the Holy Spirit of promiſe is ſaid to be, <hi>the earneſt of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſsion:</hi> The price of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Redemption is already paid, and accepted by God, and they are redeemed from their vain converſation; but their day of redemption can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be fully come, till this corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble have put on incorruption, at leaſt, not till this life be ended; for till then</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their Redemption from the power and dominion of ſin hath not its full effect: even a <hi>Paul,</hi> as long as he is in the body, hath occaſion
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52563:31" rendition="simple:additions"/> to complain that he is ſold under ſin, and that the law in the members warreth againſt the law of the mind, and leadeth him captive to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin, and omiſſion of Duty.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Till then, our Redemption, <hi>the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. is not perfect. I know that upon our firſt cloſing with Chriſt, our <hi>tranſgreſsions are blotted out as a miſt, and as a thick cloud, and our iniquities thrown into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the Sea, there is no condemnation to us,</hi> no obligation to Eternal wrath; but yet I am alſo ſure, that we are bid <hi>repent, that our ſins may be blotted out when the daies of refreſhing ſhall come from the Lord, Acts.</hi> 3.19. Whence it may be inferred, that a Penitents ſins are not ſo blotted out, as then they ſhall be blotted out; indeed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt converſion, a man is put into a ſtate of juſtification, which is inconſiſtent with obligation to Eternal death, yet is he not freed from all puniſhment, nor from all obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for where there is no obligation to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there is no juſtice in puniſhing. The want of the Spirit is one of the puniſhments we have brought on our ſelves by ſin: this puniſhment is not taken away, but by reſtoring of the Spirit; now though the Spirit be ſo reſtored, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vent the dominion of Sin, and damnation for the time to come, yet is it not given in ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:52563:31"/> as to prevent all ſin, nor the contracting of new guilt; nor ſhall He be ſo given in this world.</p>
               <p n="3">III. As to the Redemption of the Body, that is ſo far from being compleat before the Great Day, that till then it may ſeem not to begin: While it is joyned to an imperfect ſoul 'tis vile and mortal; when ſeparated from it, then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes yet viler, is thrown into a grave, and preyed upon by worms and maggots: at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection it begins to be ſpiritual, incorruptible, powerfull, and like to the glorious body of Chriſt Jeſus. The Adoption, the Redemption of the Body, we do not now enjoy, but by Faith and Hope we do wait for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. On all theſe accounts, there is reaſon why that Day ſhould be called, as it is, <hi>The manifeſtation of the ſons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.19. <hi>For though we be now the ſons of God, it appears not what we ſhall be,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1. The beſt uſe that can be made of this Appellation, is that which is made of it by the whole Creation; <hi>The ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt expectation of the creature waiteth for this manifeſtation, that it may be delivered from that bondage and vanity unto which it is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and under which it groaneth; much more ſhould you, who have the firſt-fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, groan within your ſelves, waiting for the adoption.</hi> 'Tis utterly a fault among Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:52563:32"/> that they groan ſo much under the burden of a few Taxes and Impoſitions, and ſo little under the burden and body of Sin which they carry about with them. They ſhould much and frequently bleſs God for thoſe enjoyments they have of him in this earthly Tabernacle; but yet not be ſo ſatisfied with any ſuch enjoyments, as not to deſire it may be diſſolved, and ſo they put into the poſſeſſion of that houſe in heavens not made with hands. <hi>We that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.4. I confeſs, in this I look on St. <hi>Paul</hi> as our Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, rather then as our Standard: I dare not ſay, that all who are partakers of the Spirit do thus earneſtly groan after abſence from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and preſence with the Lord; but all have reaſon ſo to do, elſe had not all by Chriſt been taught to pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi> As for you who live in ſin, I cannot exhort you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire this day; rather you may pray as did the Primitive Chriſtians, though on a better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>Pro morâ finis;</hi> for to you this Day of the Lord ſhal not be a day of Redemption, but of Confinement to the darkeſt dungeon; it ſhal <hi>burn as an Oven,</hi> it ſhall burn you up, and leave you neither root nor branch: The Devils who believe it, do tremble at the thoughts of it; and if you
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:52563:32"/> tremble not at it, it is becauſe you believe it not. The beſt and moſt ſeaſonable advice I can give you, is, to kiſs the Redeemer, and to follow God with ſighs and groans, till he hath given you hearts ſoft as wax, then ſhall you alſo be <hi>ſealed to the day of Redemption,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this <hi>Sealing of the Spirit</hi> I am now to ſpeak, and that ſomewhat largely: being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to build high, it is good to dig deep, and lay the foundation ſure. The expreſſion is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly Metaphorical, and muſt betoken ſomething that bears proportion to Sealing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called: What that is, we ſhould the rather enquire, becauſe the Metaphor is ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed here, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.13. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. He that ſhall read the Learned <hi>Zanchy</hi> on <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. will not loſe his labour, nay, will think nothing can be added unto what he hath ſaid. I ſhall from him and others, in a few words, lend light enough to elucidate this matter to thoſe that have a mind to underſtand. Two things among us go by the name of a Seal.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Signet</hi> that makes the <hi>Impreſsion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Impreſsion</hi> that is made by the <hi>Signet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>ſealing,</hi> if conſidered in its nature, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the imparting of the Image of the Signet to that which is ſealed: But then the uſes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:52563:33"/> of ſealing are divers; 1. For <hi>ſecreſie</hi> or <hi>ſecurity;</hi> 2. For <hi>ratification</hi> or <hi>confirmation;</hi> 3. For <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> or <hi>ſeparation:</hi> Now the queſtion is, Whether in alluſion to the nature, of ſome or all uſes of <hi>ſealing,</hi> we are ſaid to be <hi>ſealed?</hi> Doubtleſs, the Spirit doth work in us ſo as to communicate unto us the <hi>likeneſs of God</hi> in <hi>holineſs</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs. By him we are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the Image of God from glory to glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. laſt. <hi>According to his mercy he ſaveth us by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Tit. 3.5. <hi>We are born again of water and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Joh. 3.3. <hi>We are waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we are ſanctified, we are juſtified, in the Name of our Lord Jeſus, and by the Spirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11. But ſeeing the <hi>ſealing</hi> here intended is in order of nature after <hi>believing, Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. I humbly conceive, it is not the making of the Elect to partake of the Divine Nature, but the aſſuring of them that they do partake of it, the perſwading our hearts that we have Gods mark on us. God ſeals us with his Spirit, not that he may know us to be his, but that we may know our ſelves to be his, and reſt ſatisfied that we are his, and that he will own us for his, when to others he ſhall ſay, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not.</hi> I deny not, but we may be ſaid to be <hi>ſealed</hi> by the Spirit,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:52563:33"/> when we are by him regenerated and made new creatures; but I think Regeneration is rather the Spirits <hi>writing the law in our hearts,</hi> and making us the <hi>Epiſtle of God;</hi> and that the ſealing in the Text intended, is the Spirits teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying unto us that we are of the number of Gods redeemed ones, and have a right to the priviledges of Gods redeemed ones. Now there are five things of which the Spirit may be thought to give aſſurance. 1. Election. 2. Vocation. 3. Juſtification. 4. Perſeverance. 5. Eternal life; but becauſe of ſome of theſe there is diſpute, and becauſe it is by all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber perſons granted, that effectual vocation, regeneration, converſion are the evidences of the other, of that chiefly, and well nigh, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſhall ſpeak, and caſt all I have to ſay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it into an Anſwer to theſe ſix Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whether ſuch Aſſurance may be had?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether the nature of Faith conſiſt in it and whether it may not be ſeparated from Faith?</p>
               <p n="3">3. How the Spirit works it?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Why ſo many Chriſtians are ſo long without it?</p>
               <p n="5">5. What motives there be to perſwade us to labour after it.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:52563:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>6. What means are to be uſed, 1. to gain it if we have it not, 2. to keep it if we have it, 3. to regain it if we have loſt it?</p>
               <p n="1">1. In anſwer to the Queſtion, <hi>Whether ſuch aſſurance may be had,</hi> I ſay it may, which I prove,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By arguing <hi>ab eſſe ad poſſe;</hi> Aſſurance hath by many been attained, therefore it may be attained. That it hath been attained is ſo evident, that ſcarce any thing can be more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident; there is not one Saint almoſt in all the Scriptures, concerning whom much is ſaid, of whom ſomething is not ſaid, from which it may be collected that he had ſometime or other good aſſurance of Gods love. Was <hi>Job,</hi> think we, without aſſurance, who maintained his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity againſt the devil, and his uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable friends, clubbing their wits to prove him an Hypocrite? Was not that the voice of aſſurance, <hi>I know that my redeemer liveth?</hi> Was not the Spouſe aſſured when ſhe ſaid, <hi>I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved is mine?</hi> Was not St. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſured, when he ſo trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed in Chriſt? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.38. <hi>I am perſwaded that neither life, nor death, nor Angels, nor principalities, &amp;c. ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The Papiſts do not much deny but that theſe perſons, and ſundry others mentioned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:52563:34"/> had aſſurance; onely they ſay, they came to it in an extraordinary way, by immediate revelation; which muſt needs be looked on as a meer evaſion and ſhift: there is not in Scripture the leaſt hint that theſe came to their aſſurance in any extraordinary way, but many things there be in Scripture which make manifeſt, that they attained their certainty in a diſcurſive way, arguing from the effect, to the cauſe; from the fruits, to the root; from their mortifying the deeds of the fleſh, and walking according to the Spirit, to the Spirits dwelling in them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed had his Revelations, but thoſe were not the ordinary ſtanding laſting ground of his gloriation, but <q>the teſtimony of his Conſcience that in ſimplicity, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdome, but by the grace of God, he had had his converſation in the World.</q> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. What that, we are bid by St. <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>give all diligence to make our calling and election ſure.</hi> 2. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1.10. Which implyeth that aſſurance is not onely to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by extraordinary immediate Revelation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we cannot have aſſurance, 'tis either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot be ſure what puts us into a ſtate of grace, or becauſe we cannot be ſure that we are in that ſtate of grace. To ſay, that we cannot know what puts us into a ſtate of grace or makes
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:52563:35"/> us children of God and diſciples of Chriſt, is too great an abſurdity for the Papiſts themſelves to ſwallow; it doth indeed make the one half of the Scriptures needleſs, for what doth Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture more deſign, then to lay down the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing marks betwixt ſincerity and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryſie, faith and unbelief, the power of Godlineſs and the form? It will therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be ſaid, that we may know what true grace is, but we cannot know our ſelves to have true grace wrought in us, becauſe of the deceitfulneſs of our hearts. Now that the heart of man is deceitfull, deceitfull above all things, will not be denied by any who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtudieth Scripture or his own heart. But we may well ſay, that the deceitfulneſs, whether natural or acquired, is in part cured and removed by ſanctifying grace, and the Spirit alſo doth aſſiſt (as is more to be ſhewen hereafter) the ſanctified faculty to obſerve and take notice of its own frame; and therefore, its remaining deceitfulneſs notwithſtanding, it may come to ſome certainty of its own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. To make ſhort, I ask, Was Conſcience deſigned by God to be a Witneſs, and a judge, did he intend it ſhould ſomtimes juſtifie, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times condemn? If he did not deſign it to any ſuch work or office, why then all, both
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:52563:35"/> Heathens and Chriſtians have miſtaken its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and office; if he did, why then may not a renewed Conſcience witneſs concerning a mans renewed and juſtified condition? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it may witneſs and give ſuch a Teſtimony as God will own hereafter, and man may for the preſent comfortably acquieſce in. As from <q>our hearts condemning us, we may infer that God will condemn us; ſo from our hearts not condemning us, we may collect, that God will not condemn us; and that with ſuch firmneſs or certainty, as will give us bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the preſence of God, <hi>and aſſure our hearts before him that we ſhall have the things we ask of him.</hi>
                  </q> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20, 21. Had the Teſtimony been ſo obſcure and uncertain as Papiſts make it to be, St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not have ſo rejoiced and gloried in it, as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved him to do, from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If no aſſurance were attainable then ſome duties enjoined us would be altogether either unprofitable, or impoſſible; I inſtance in two or three: Why are we bid to <hi>ſearch and try our waies,</hi> if it cannot be known whether they are right? Why are we bid to examine our ſelves <hi>whether we be in the faith,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. if it cannot be known <hi>whether we be in the faith?</hi> How ſhould we <hi>rejoice in the Lord,</hi> and <hi>glory in
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:52563:36"/> tribulation,</hi> if when we have done all, our title to heaven muſt be uncertain, if we may at laſt for ought we know to the contrary, have our portion in the lake that burnes with fire and brimſtone?</p>
               <p>Set a man upon a very high pinacle, and let him know he may fall from it, and ſee whether you can perſwade him to rejoice; the poſſibility, and much more the probability of any danger that is intolerable, muſt needs damp all joy. Much leſs could a Chriſtian be earneſt and vehement in his deſires to be diſſolved and be with Chriſt, if he could have no ſure hope that when he is diſſolved he ſhould be found in Chriſt. Why hath God ſet Promiſes as thick in the Word as Stars in the Firmament, if by no means we can clear up our intereſt in them? If the ſweetneſs of all the Covenant were ſtrained into one ſingle Promiſe, what would that avail me, if by no means I could be perſwaded that I ſhall one day be permitted to taſte of it. This argument did horribly puzzle <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> and in anſwer to it he recites three opinions of Catholicks, (as he calls them) according to none of which, he thinks, men will be left under any neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of doubting concerning their reconciliation with God; and at laſt he tells us, that all they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:52563:36"/> contend againſt, is onely a certainty of Faith properly ſo called: but we are wiſer then to lay the ſtreſs of ſo material a queſtion upon a School-phraſe. Let it but be granted, that the ſoul can have ſuch a knowledge of its own ſincerity, as makes it certain that it is not miſtaken, we ſhall ſit down under the ſhadow of that conceſſion, and eat the ſweet fruit of it, leaving it to the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Doctors to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine whether this may be called Faith Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick; and if not, whether yet it may not be called Divine Faith, differing from Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith; differing not in certainty and exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of doubting, but onely in univerſality. I muſt needs ſay, I underſtand not how any man can be ſaid to believe that he believes; and if any of our Writers have ſo expreſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (which is more then I know) they ſpoke not properly. <q>
                     <hi>Wendeline,</hi> in his larger <hi>Syſtem</hi> of Divinity, propounding againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf this objection, as from the Papiſts; What is certain with the certainty of Faith, is either expreſly contained in the Word of God, or by due conſequence may be thence deduced: But that this or that man, I, or thou do truly believe, is not expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, nor can by any due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence be thence deduced;</q> therefore it
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:52563:37"/> cannot be certain with a certainty of Faith; doth well anſwer, The concluſion doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict us; for we do not in kind ſay, that we can by a certainty of Faith be certain that <q>we truly believe, but indefinitely, that we may be certain. With what certainty then? I anſwer with a certainty of inward viſion, or the teſtimony of our mind enlightned by the holy Spirit, who witneſſeth to our ſpirit, that we are the ſons of God, and do truly believe: This certainty therefore is not written in the book of Scripture, but in the book of our heart, and that by the finger of the Spirit. Hence we believe not that we believe, but ſee, feel; As we do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we do think of God, but know and perceive by our mind: quoting for the confirmation of his anſwer, an elegant ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of S. <hi>Auguſtine, lib.</hi> 13. <hi>De Trin. Fidem ſuam quiſque, qui eam habet, videt in corde ſuo, &amp; tenet certiſsimâ ſcientiâ, &amp; clamante conſcientia.</hi>
                  </q> In which way if he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in anſwering the ſelf ſame objection concerning particular remiſſion of ſin, pag. 1158. he had given the adverſary leſs advantage; for my part, I do not make it any Article of my Faith that my ſins are pardoned.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We argue the attainableneſs of Aſſurance
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:52563:37"/> from the weakneſs and rottenneſs of the grounds on which the Papiſts, the greateſt adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to this truth, do proceed in the denying of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis not unlike, that the covetouſneſs of the Pope and his Clergy is one reaſon why the doctrine of Aſſurance is ſo denyed: For this ſect of men is ſomewhat a kin to <hi>Judas, who was a Thief, and carried the Bag.</hi> Were the Pope to pay as much for redeeming a Soul out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, as he commonly gets by it, I dare ſay, Purgatory before this had been reckoned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt things that are not: were they to looſe as much gold and ſilver by keeping men in doubts and fears as commonly they get, certainty had not been made ſo impoſſible as now it is.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their own Hypocriſie and formality makes them, and that juſtly, to queſtion their own ſtate preſent and to come, and therefore they think that none, how ſincere and upright ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, can be aſſured of theſe matters. Very apt we be to meaſure other mens cloth by our own ells, to make our own hearts and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a ſtandard and pattern to our fellow Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Many eminent Reformers, who had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the candle of the Lord moſtly ſhining on them, and lived perpetually under the beams of his countenance, did place Faith in Aſſurance, and ſo diſcouraged ſome weak Chriſtians. The
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:52563:38"/> Papiſts on the other hand, being alway void of aſſurance; would needs perſwade us, that no Faith did ever riſe up to aſſurance, being continually tormented with ſhivering fears, they envy all others who have more ſerenity and calmneſs then themſelves. But doth it follow, that if an houſe built on the ſands cannot ſtand, that it cannot ſtand neither though built on the rock? A Papiſt, as a Papiſt, holdeth no one doctrine by faith; for ſeeing, as Papiſt, he muſt needs take the Popes infallibility in cauſes of faith for his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which foundation being not onely untrue, but alſo heretical, cannot be apprehended by faith, it follows, that he neither doth nor can believe any point of ſaith, unleſs perhaps the concluſion can be of faith, when the premiſes or cauſe of aſſent to that concluſion is contrary to Faith. Nor can they have any certainty of their ſalvation; for that depends with them on their having the Sacrament of penance truly adminiſtred, and this on his being a Prieſt that doth adminiſter it: now that any one is a Prieſt, is that of which there can be no certainty; for, for ought any one knows to the contrary, he that ordained him had not intent to ordain him, or he that baptiſed him had no intent to baptiſe him; or if both could be known to have directed their intentions aright, yet twenty other things
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:52563:38"/> might happen that would nullifie his prieſthood, But no neceſſity is there that Proteſtants ſhould be uncertain of their right to, or meetneſs for heaven, who reject all theſe errors, and are taught to believe, that no man ſhall ever fare the worſe for what never was in his power to prevent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Papiſts much object the multitude of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, who have much boaſted and talked of aſſurance, and yet neither had it, nor could have it, as by their manifold miſcarriages, inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate walkings, they have moſt manifeſtly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. This no doubt they may have obſerved, and it hath been, of late years eſpecially, a great ſtumbling block to ſome, to ſee and hear perſons of very ſlight and frothy ſpirits, tell ſo many and ſo high ſtories of their enjoyments and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences. But ſhall we ſay, that a man may not be certain of that, about which multitudes have been miſtaken? Who ſees not then that we muſt bring Pirrhoniſme into the World? put our ſelves under a neceſſity of turning Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks? Becauſe ſome have phanſied their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to be full of company, when no perſon was nigh them, cannot I be ſure that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I ſee people ſitting in their ſeats to hear me? Becauſe ſome have imagined that they ſat about richly furniſhed tables, when no meat was nigh them, cannot I therefore be ſure, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:52563:39"/> my meat is before me, and give God thanks for it. There is no ſuch great likeneſs betwixt Aſſurance and Preſumption, that a man, if he will be ſincere, need miſtake the one for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The rules given by Divines to diſtinguiſh them, are ſuch, that a man cannot be miſtaken about them, unleſs he have a mind to be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Preſumption is the daughter of Ignorance, ſo is not Aſſurance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Preſumption is got and maintained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difficulty or pains, ſo is not Aſſurance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Preſumption, unleſs in great extremities, when uſually it turns into deſpair, is alway uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and like unto it ſelf, ſo is not aſſurance, which is higher or lower, according to the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Spirit, growth and exerciſe of the habit of Faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Preſumption is unwilling to be examined, ſo is not Aſſurance, but moſt gladly joyns with the moſt lively and ſearching Miniſtry; by theſe and many other characters which ſhall be after ſuggeſted, Aſſurance may as eaſily be diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from Preſumption, as may the true metal from that which doth but counterfeit it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is much urged that Aſſurance would breed Pride, ſecurity, careleſneſs, the bane of all our graces and pious endeavours: but to this many anſwers may be returned</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:52563:39"/>1. By conceſſion; it will not be denied, but that if God ſhould pour this wine into old bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, there might be danger of their breaking; if he ſhould give theſe apples to thoſe who were never ſick of love, they might breed wind: but God never gives the new name, but where he gives the new nature; He ſets not his Seal on a flint, but on the wax; <hi>In whom after ye believed, ye were ſealed with the Spirit of promiſe, Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. As for unbelievers, they are uncapable of it; and could they have it, they would turn it into wantonneſs, as they do all Grace they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: nay, nor doth God ſet his Seal on every veſſel of Honour; He doth not feed every child with hidden Manna, but onely ſuch as he findes to hunger after it, and to be ready to faint and periſh without it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſay our Aſſurance is not perfect or free from all doubts, but hath alway mixed with it ſome either actual or habitual fear. Perfect Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance might (ſuch is the corruption remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in us) be abuſed to ſecurity, and occaſion Pride; but our wine is mixed with water, on purpoſe, that it might not intoxicate us. With ſuch a meaſure of Aſſurance we are truſted, as keeps under doubts and fears, not with ſuch as quite expels doubts and fears. They go too far, who ſay, That the aſſurance we have
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:52563:40"/> of the pardon of our ſins, and right to Eternal Life, is equal to the aſſurance we have of the common objects of Faith, Chriſts Reſurrection, or Gods Omnipotence. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>riſen,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Almighty,</hi> are Propoſitions and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that are expreſly and immediately contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scriptures, and therefore do the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily gain aſſent from our Underſtandings: But theſe Propoſitions, I am <hi>juſtified,</hi> I am <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> I ſhall be <hi>ſaved,</hi> are Concluſions drawn from ſuch Premiſes of which onely one is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, the other is made out by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe and feeling, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Concluſion is not ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, nor ſo ſtrictly <note n="*" place="margin">Dico non eſſe adeo ſtricte de ſide, ne offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculum creem Lectori in hiſce controverſiis minus exercitato, alioqui mea ſic ſtat ſententia, iſtiuſmodi concluſiones non eſſe omnino de fide: Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem ſequi infirmiorem premiſſam eſt è trivio dialecticorum Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, quem et ſi aliqui dialecticorum filii de ſola affirmatione, aut ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatione, univerſalitate aut particularitate Propoſitionum intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, videtur tamen extendendus etiam ad praemiſſarum evidenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am &amp; inevidentiam; poteſt ſieri ut propoſitio de ſide licet in ſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior, quoad nos tamen qui in arguendo ſenſu ac ratione ducimur, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior ac debilior ſit propoſitione illâ qua eſt evidens quoad ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem aut ſenſum prout accidit in hoc ſyllogiſmo; Omnis homo reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, Ego ſum homo, Ergo, Ego reſurgam, tum Concluſio est de ſide: Major enim quae eſt de fide in diſſereado eſt infirmior praemiſſa, at in tali ſyllogiſm<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. I do utterly deny, that Aſſurance, as aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, doth breed ſecurity and negligence; but rather in a meet ſubject it quickens to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. For what? are not the Angels in Heaven aſſured of Gods love? do they not more then opine or conjecture, that they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall away from it? yet, I trow, they do not therefore grow negligent, but continue to be miniſtring ſpirits, ready preſſed to go whether ſoever God ſends them. Indeed were it ſo that aſſurance either of Faith, or of pardon did bread ſlothfulneſs naturally and neceſſarily, a man would be afraid to grow in grace; for undoubtedly, the more growth in grace, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the more aſſurance; the faſter hold I lay on Chriſt, the greater evidence that I have him, the ſtronger the habit of Faith is, the more vigorouſly it acteth, and the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty it carries along with it, that it is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and unfeigned: now if this evidence and certainty were ſuch as did of its own nature miniſter to ſecurity and negligence, better it were that I ſhould content my ſelf with the Faith and Love of a Child, then of a grown and perfect man.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:52563:41"/>II. In anſwer to the ſecond queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith do conſiſt in aſſurance,</hi> I anſwer by laying down this Propoſition.</p>
               <p>Faith conſiſts not in Aſſurance either that a man loveth God, or is loved of God, or that God hath pardoned him, or will ſave him; yea, true Faith may be in him, in whom there is no ſuch perſwaſion.</p>
               <p>This Propoſition ſeems moſt clear to me; yet I may fear it will not down with all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome are uſed to the definitions of men of very great name, who make a Chriſtian mans Faith to be a perſwaſion that Chriſt died for him and hath procured the pardon of his ſins, and the ſalvation of his ſoul. Which Phraſes are in themſelves capable of a good conſtruction. Every Believer is perſwaded that Chriſt hath procured Remiſſion of his ſinnes, and ſalvation to be beſtowed on him in Gods way, and upon Gods termes and conditions; but they expound themſelves thus, That it is of the nature of true Faith to make a man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that remiſſion of ſins is not onely by Chriſt obtained for him, but alſo applied to him, and that God by an unchangeable decree elected him to eternal ſalvation. Now this is an error, and ſuch an error as though it hath had too many followers; yet hath alway, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:52563:41"/> in <hi>England;</hi> met with ſome to oppoſe it as appears by Mr. <hi>John Foxe's</hi> Treatiſe <hi>De Chriſto gratis juſtificante.</hi> But till of late no man took ſo much pains ſtrenuouſly to refute it, as did Mr. <hi>John Down,</hi> in Vindication of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon from the Exceptions of Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſomtimes Lecturer of the City of <hi>Briſtoll.</hi> The arguments he then made uſe of, are ſo ſtrong, that I need not put my ſelf to the trouble of excogitating new ones, but ſhall as to the ſubſtance of what I ſay, plow with his heifer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This perſwaſion and particular applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they ſpeak of cannot be Faith, becauſe it is frequently loſt. This argument holds ſtrong againſt thoſe who deny that true Faith can be loſt, (ſuch are all with whom I now deal) unleſs they will ſay, that the perſwaſion of Gods ſpecial love is never loſt, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to manifeſt experience. For had not, <hi>Heman</hi> the <hi>Ezrahite</hi> loſt it, when he cryeth out <hi>Pſa.</hi> 88, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>My ſoul is full of trouble, and my life draweth nigh unto the grave, I am counted with them that go down into the pit, I am as a man that hath no ſtrength, free among the dead, thy wrath lieth hard on me, thou haſt afflicted me with all thy waves,</hi> how many have we our ſelves known delighting themſelves with ſpiritual ſuavities, filled with joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ful of glory? yet within a ſhort time down
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:52563:42"/> in the mouth again, queſtioning whether ever they had the Spirit, whether all that in which they bleſſed themſelves were not a meer deluſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Faith cannot be this perſwaſion, becauſe ſome true Believers never did, never can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto ſuch perſwaſion. I inſtance in thoſe who do maintain principles quite inconſiſtent with it, <hi>viz. Lutherans.</hi> This is plainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by <hi>Laterman,</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divine of <hi>Regiomount,</hi> for the which conceſſion he is cenſured and condemned by ſome of his own party, by none more bitterly then by <hi>Walther,</hi> but certainly without a cauſe; for by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they proceed upon, no man ordinarily can be certain of his Election, or perſeverance, till he be breathing out his laſt breath: let them frame what practical Syllogiſmes they will, it will be found, that either the <hi>Major</hi> is falſe or the <hi>Minor</hi> doubtfull and uncertain, as will appear to any who will but take the pains to form all the anſwers by which <hi>Brockman</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to quiet the conſcience of one doubting concerning his election, <hi>loco de Praed. pag.</hi> 689. into Syllogiſms; He there bids a Man be certain of his election that finds himſelf to love Chriſt, and diligently to endeavour the reformation of his life, thence the Syllogiſm will be. He that loves Chriſt, &amp; diligently endeavours
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:52563:42"/> to amend his life, is ordained to eternal life; I love Chriſt and endeavour diligently to amend my life therefore I am ordained to eternal life: Is the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi> here true or falſe? if it be true, then it is their error to ſay that love to Chriſt is not proper to the elect; if it be falſe, what becomes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion inferred from it. If it be ſaid, which is all they can ſay, that if aman can feel in his heart a ſenſe of Gods love, he may thence infer a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal certainty of his election <hi>viz,</hi> If he ſhall perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in his love, that is no more then what the non-Elect may have. Suppoſe we one of them to know that he is a believer, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not he thence infer that he is elected, or ſhall perſevere to eternal life, becauſe he neither thinks true faith to be proper to Gods elect, nor to have any promiſe of certain perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance made to it: to ſay that none of theſe brethren are true believers, is the higheſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs, for what Scripture is it ſaith, that it is eſſential to Chriſtianity, to be rightly informed concerning the connexion of faith with election? or where is this doctrine ſo clearly revealed in the word, as that all muſt needs be ſuppoſed to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully blind who will not ſee and acknowledge it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This perſwaſion is in order of Nature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Faith, therefore the nature of Faith can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie in it. The Antecedent is preſently proved,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52563:43"/> becauſe I muſt firſt be in the favour of God, which I cannot be but by Faith, 'ere I can know or be perſwaded that I am in the favour of God; for a propoſition is alway in order of nature true, before it is known to be true, as every mans reaſon doth tell him. And this order, as it hath its foundation in reaſon, ſo alſo in Scripture: 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.13. <hi>Theſe things have I written to you that believe in the name of the Son of God,</hi> that ye may know ye have eternal life. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaw this, and therefore inferrs, that according to the opinion commonly received among Reformed Divines in his time, men are juſtified before they do believe: and methinks the learned <hi>Chamier</hi> doth not like himſelf, when he goes about to untie this knot, for he ſaith, that Faith doth, if not in order of time, yet of nature, follow juſtification; a ſaying contrary to the whole current of Scripture.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If Faith did conſiſt in this perſwaſion, it would follow that ſome who do hear the Goſpel, either were not bound to believe, or were bound to believe a lie. That any who hear the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ſhould not be bound to believe, cannot be, for then unbelief would be no ſin to them; and if no ſin, then could it not deſerve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; when as we know from Scripture, that it is the condemning ſin: And that ſome,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52563:43"/> if obliged to believe that either they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, or juſtified, would be bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lie, is as plain; for certainly, among thoſe that hear the Goſpel, ſome are not choſen, nor pardoned. But what is more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, then that any man ſhould be bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lie? can any thing be the object of faith but what is true? or any thing the object of Divine Faith, but what is ſo true that it cannot be falſe?</p>
               <p>More need not be ſaid againſt this error. But it will be asked, whether, though the nature of Faith do not conſiſt in this aſſurance, yet it be not that which every believer doth ſome time or other find? or whether any Child of God do ſo walk in darkneſs, as that the light of Gods countenance is never lifted up on him, no not before his death.</p>
               <p>This I ſhall endeavour to anſwer by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing concluſions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. No queſtion, as the Sun, after it hath for all the day been hid in the clouds, doth ſometimes ſhew it ſelf and that gloriouſly juſt before it ſets; ſo the Faith of a Chriſtian, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it hath for the greateſt part of his life been clouded with doubts and fears, doth near unto his death ſometimes ſo manifeſt it ſelf by ſome lively acts, as that he can no longer doubt of its ſincerity, but cries out my Lord, my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52563:44"/> In that little, experience I have had in the world, I have known ſundry who have all their life been ſubject to fears, and filled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Miniſter and Chriſtian of their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with dreadful complaints againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; who yet, when they have been on their death-beds, or have apprehended themſelves ſo to be, have triumphed over death in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles language, <hi>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave where is thy victory?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. They that are in the leaſt converſant in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh <hi>Martyrology,</hi> cannot but know how uſual it was with God to ſeal up his love to his ſervants juſt when he called them out to ſet their own ſeals to his truth; ſo high was their aſſurance, that you would have thought that they had heard the Muſick of the Coeleſtial Choire, when they heard the ratling of the chains with which they were to be tied to the ſtake. When Mr. <hi>Robert Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> was condemned to die, and was now at a point to be delivered out of the world, it ſo happened, that two or three days before, his heart being lumpiſh, and deſtitute of all true conſolation, he felt in himſelf no aptneſs, but rather an heavineſs (I all along uſe Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> his own words) and dulneſs of Spirit, fall of much diſcomfort, to bear the bitter
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:52563:44"/> croſs of Martyrdom; whereupon fearing in himſelf leſt the Lord had utterly withdrawn his wonted favour from him, he made his moan to a Miniſter, complaining how earneſtly he had prayed day and night, and yet could receive no motion nor ſenſe of comfort from God: but ſo ſoon as he came to the ſight of the ſtake, he was ſo mightily repleniſhed with Gods holy comfort and heavenly joys that he cryed out, clapping his hands, <hi>Auſtin,</hi> (that was the name of the Miniſter to whom he had complained) <hi>He is come, he is come.</hi> The Apoſtles that did alway beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in their bodies the dying of our Lord Jeſus, that were alway delivered unto death for Jeſus ſake, had alſo the life of Chriſt made ſo manifeſt in them, that though they were troubled on every ſide, yet they were not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed; did ſo conſtantly and aſſuredly know, that he which raiſed up Jeſus, would raiſe them up alſo by Jeſus, and that their light affl<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were but for a moment wrought for them a far more exceeding eternal weight of glory, that they did not faint, but rather wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more bold by their bonds. The ſame truth might alſo be compaſſed about with a cloud of witneſſes of ſuch as did die a natural death: But that work is done to our hands
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52563:45"/> by <hi>Melchior Adam,</hi> and others, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to us the ſtory of the life and death of men famous in their generations for piety and learning. Yea, ſo uſual is it with Chriſts Diſciples to have their inward man renewed day by day, when their outward man periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks indefinitely, <hi>mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace, Pſal.</hi> 37.37.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Sometimes it falls out quite otherwaies; thoſe who in their life time have had much enjoyment of the ſenſe of Gods love, and through it have comforted themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have yet died with little, if any, aſſurance, or actual comfort, this God ſuffers for many holy, wiſe ends and purpoſes; as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To quicken others up to the greater preparation. When death is at a diſtance, we are apt to think it is but an eaſie thing to die: But when we ſhall ſee that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of death have ſtartled and grievouſly affrighted thoſe whom we ever judged to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel us in grace, we muſt needs, if not faſt aſleep, begin to look about us, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether we with our weak imperfect graces are able to meet with that Prince of terrors? and the more importunately to pray for, and depend upon ſome ſtrength greater then our own.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:52563:45"/>2. God may permit it judicially, for the hardning of prophane Worldlings and carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts; who ſeeing ſome of their looſe compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to go out of the world like lambs, <hi>to have no bands in their death, Pſal.</hi> 73. to depart quiet, peaceable, confident, void of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, deſpair, or fear; and others, who have made greater profeſſion of Godlineſs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured after greater exactneſs, die under many troubleſome, diſquieting thoughts, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conclude, that all which conſcientious Miniſters preſs upon their followers, is but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary ſowerneſs, and melancholy ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. God counts not himſelf any way engaged to remove ſuch ſtones at which he foreſees ſuch ſelf-deluding ſots will ſtumble and fall, and never riſe more; rather he may ſeem on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to order it ſo, that they who will get no good by his Servants life, ſhall receive no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by their death.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As a puniſhment to his Servants for their declinings and fallings from <hi>their firſt love,</hi> a ſin big enough to provoke him to remove his Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick from a whole Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4, 5. much more not to let his candle ſhine on the tabernacle of ſome one ſingle Chriſtian, how eminent ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. As <hi>love perfects its ſelf,</hi> ſo <hi>fear is caſt out,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.18. but as love weakeneth or decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:52563:46"/> ſo fear returns and tormenteth. Unto which three reaſons, we may add,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Such is the nature of ſome diſeaſes, that they do cloud the Phanſie, and muffle the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and if ſo, it is no wonder that the beſt of men do make falſe judgment of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and flie away from death, as if Chriſt had never overcome it. No wonder that a mind diſcompoſed with bodily diſtempers recoils at the ſight of eternity; rather it is a wonder, that a believer, when he is moſt himſelf, can think of that condition without aſtoniſhment; ſo ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing is the contemplation of it to thoſe who are accuſtomed to meaſure all actions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections by time.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Devil at ſuch a time will be ſure to ſtir up and make uſe of all his malice and ſubtilty. 'Tis ſaid of the natural Serpent, <hi>non niſi moriens in longum producitur,</hi> 'tis never at its full length till it be dying. The old Serpent never ſo much ſhews himſelf in his full dimenſions, as when a Chriſtian is dying; when he is juſt on the borders of the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> he will then, if he he cannot trip up, yet bruiſe his heels, that he may enter in halting and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as he would not be tormented before his time, ſo nor would he that a Chriſtian ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, before his time, hence he caſts a miſt before
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:52563:46"/> his eyes, that he may not ſee his intereſt in that place of bliſs unto which he is haſtning apace; when his time of tempting is but ſhort, then uſually he comes with the greateſt fury.</p>
               <p n="3">III. I think it is rarely ſeen, that any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Chriſtian, walking cloſely with God, doth run out the whole courſe of his life with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome aſſurance of the love of God. 'Tis not likely, that any one ſhould for months and years be joined to the Lord, and made one ſpirit with him, and the Lord not let him know that he loveth him; in Gods ordinary way of working, the ſpirit of bondage doth but make way for the Spirit of adoption. But yet,</p>
               <p n="4">IIII. 'Tis not impoſſible, that a Chriſtian ſhould live in ignorance of his own eſtate all his days. I do not find, in my beſt ſearch of Scripture, that God hath any where promiſed, that every true Faith ſhall bud and bloſſom, in aſſurance, or that he who is a Believer ſhall ſome time or other know himſelf ſo to be; and if God hath made no promiſe to work aſſurance ſome time or other in every one whom he converts, nothing there can be concluded to the contrary from reaſon: for arguing rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally, why may not he who wants it one year, want it ten? or he that wants it ten, want it all the years that he ſpends in
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:52563:47"/> the fleſh? If any one will contradict us in this, it behoves him to ſhew us any thing eſſential to a Chriſtian, which may not in ſome ſort be in the want of aſſurance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> This leads to lazineſs and idleneſs; for if men may be in the favour of God, and have a title to happineſs, and not know ſo much, they will not care though they live and die in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If ſuch a Doctrine were delivered in another matter no ſuch uſe would be made of it. If I ſhould ſay, that bread and water were as much as is neceſſary to keep life and ſoul together, would men thereupon reſolve to take no care, or have any thoughts for any provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion beyond bread and water? why ſhould Chriſtians then, when they hear that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Godlineſs may be kept up without aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, take up there?</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis a ſin to want aſſurance: We ſhould as well have peace in our own Conſciences, as peace with God; nor are our hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, till we have ſo. I know active deſertion, or Gods withdrawing of his ſhining manifeſtation is not our ſin, even Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, who though he was made ſin, yet knew no ſin, was deſerted, which made him to cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:52563:47"/> me?</hi> When he ſo cried out, we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and moſt ſober Divines do conceive, he was under the want of the influence of actual viſion, and of the actual joy and comfort of union; nor will I deny but that God may withdraw out of Soveraignty, or for the meer trial and exerciſe of our graces: but whether ever he did ſo, is more then I know; or ſhould he now do ſo, it would be but for a ſeaſon: if for any long time we want Aſſurance, 'tis through weakneſs of Faith, or through ſpiritual ſloth, or ſome other as ſinfull diſtemper. He that bids us <hi>work out our ſalvation,</hi> and <hi>make our calling and election ſure,</hi> would not let us be at uncertainties concerning our ſelves, did we not ſleight ſome Ordinance or omit ſome Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or give way to ſome Luſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Though one may be a Child of God who doth want this Aſſurance, yet is there no Child of God who ſits down ſatisfied under the want of it, who doth not deſire to attain to the full aſſurance of hope? Uncertainty of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is not ſo light an evil, as that a Chriſtian can carry it, as if it were no burden; nay, but he follows Chriſt with unutterable ſighs and groans; he travelleth from Ordinance to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, till his Evidences be cleared up, and his Title to the Promiſes of Pardon be made out.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:52563:48"/> If a Child ſhould have ſome doubt thrown into his mind concerning his Fathers love to him, would he be at reſt till it were removed? How then can any Believer be himſelf under prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doubts concerning the good will of his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father? Hath God promiſed us his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> to <hi>ſeal us up to the day of redemption;</hi> hath he beſides his Covenant given us his Sacraments, that we might have the more abundant conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and after all this ſhall we quietly ſit in the dark as if nothing ailed us? how then dwelleth the love of God in us? Eſpecially thoſe who have ſometimes had the light of Gods counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhining on them, and have after loſt it, muſt needs be reſtleſs till they have recovered it. <hi>Thou didſt hide thy face, and I was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> Pſal. 30. <hi>v.</hi> 7. Troubled with a witneſs, for it was his daily ſorrow of heart, yea, it was as death to him; for this he made his tears day and night, he poured out his ſoul in him; and his upbraidings by his enemies with this, were <hi>as a ſword in his bones,</hi> Pſal. 42.3, 4, 10. As for the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> we do find <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 6. that when her beloved had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf and was gone, <hi>her ſoul failed when ſhe ſpake; ſhe ſought, but ſhe could not find him; ſhe called, but he made no anſwer:</hi> Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſhe goes to the Watchmen, to the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:52563:48"/> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> charging them, if they found her beloved, to tell him, <hi>ſhe was ſick of love,</hi> v. 7.8. He never duly eſtimated the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſt, who can bear his ſtrangeneſs without great ſorrow and heavineſs of heart.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to the third queſtion, <hi>How, or in what way aſſurance is wrought by the Spirit,</hi> I ſay,</p>
               <p>His way of working is very dark and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious, and aſſurance it ſelf is better felt then expreſſed; compared therefore, as ſome conceive, Rev. 2.17. <hi>to the Manna that is hid, and to the white ſtono, and the new name written in the ſtone, which no man knoweth, ſaving he that receiveth it.</hi> The Spirit working in our, regeneration is inexpreſſible; compared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>John</hi> 3. to the <hi>Wind</hi> that <hi>bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> the <hi>ſound</hi> whereof we <hi>hear,</hi> but <hi>know not whence it cometh, nor whether it goeth:</hi> his working in aſſuring us that we are regenerate, is much more inexpreſſible. There are two kinds of Acts in the ſoul: 1. <hi>Direct</hi> Acts, ſuch as is that by which the ſoul cleaves to Chriſt, or lays hold on him, or believes in him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins and ſalvation. 2. <hi>Reflex</hi> Acts, ſuch as is that by which a man returns on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and doth though not believe, yet know that he believes, believes ſincerely: Such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52563:49"/> acts, are the moſt noble royal operations' the moſt refined Spiritual workings, ſufficient, if we had no other arguments, to prove the ſouls immortality. But ſuch workings of the ſoul uſually are but weak and tranſient; <hi>Radius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexus languet,</hi> is the rule in Opticks; and which leaves us at a greater loſs, thoſe places of Scripture from which we ſhould borrow our light in this matter, are ſo vexed with varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of deſcants and interpretations, that it is not eaſie to know what to make of them; It would quite tire out the patience of an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reader, if I ſhould but recite the variety of Comments on that place. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.8. <hi>There are three that bear record on earth; the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Water, the Blood; and theſe three agree in one.</hi> That indeed ſeems to be more plain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16. <hi>The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God.</hi> But firſt <hi>Grotius</hi> will have <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and he brings for proof a place or two in Scripture, in which it ſeems to be ſo uſed, becauſe it is applyed to the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Conſcience; well, having no other foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to build his conceit on, we may eaſily rid our hands of him; for the witneſs of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is a joint witneſs, it witneſſeth together with God, and is therefore called as ſome
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52563:49"/> think <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. But then granting that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> doth ſignifie a joint-witneſſing, it will not be ſo eaſie to find out what the other partner is that is joined with Gods Spirit in this action; as we tranſlate, it ſhould ſeem to be <hi>our own Spirit;</hi> But the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> tranſlate, not <hi>with our Spirit,</hi> but <hi>to our Spirit,</hi> which tranſlation is put into the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles now read, and was in the Text of thoſe formerly uſed; and then it will be a queſtion, whether our ſpirit be not <hi>the joint-witneſſer,</hi> but onely the <hi>recipient</hi> of this witneſs, and the joint-witneſſer the Son of God, or that voice cauſed in us by the Spirit of God. Yet becauſe ſome do therefore want aſſurance becauſe they look for it in an undue and unwarrantable manner, expecting ſome vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call teſtimony to tell them, that they are the children of God, I ſhall therefore endeavour to unfold the matter as I am able. And this I lay down in the firſt place.</p>
               <p>That look in what way the <hi>Spirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage</hi> doth work Fear, in the ſame way the <hi>Spirit of Adoption</hi> doth work Hope and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: now the Spirit bringeth unconverted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under fears and troubles concerning their eſtate, by convincing them of the demerit of ſin, and ſhewing them that they are under the power of ſin, <hi>John,</hi> 16.8. <hi>He will convince the

               <p>Every liar ſhall have his portion in the lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone.</p>
               <p>I am a Liar.</p>
               <p>Therefore, I ſhall have my portion in the lake that burnes with fire and brimſtone.</p>
               <p>Or</p>
               <p>He that believeth not, is condemned already.</p>

               <p>Therefore, I am condemned already,</p>
               <p>Or</p>
               <p>He that hateth his brother is a murderer, and hath not eternal life.</p>
               <p>I hate my Brother.</p>
               <p>Therefore, I am a Murderer, and have not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:52563:50"/>
               <p>Theſe are all of them concluſions quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the vain principles that did dwell in the ſecure ſinner; which being ſet home by the Spirit, muſt needs make him fear what ſhal become of him. In like manner doth the Spirit bring <hi>the heirs of the promiſe,</hi> to the aſſurance of hope, by ſome ſuch practical Syllogiſms as theſe.</p>
               <p>He that loves the Brethren is paſſed from death to life.</p>
               <p>I love the Brethren.</p>
               <p>Therefore, I am paſſed from death to life.</p>
               <p>Or,</p>
               <p>He that repents and believes ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>I repent and believe.</p>
               <p>Therefore, I ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Now the Spirit hath revealed, and inſpired holy men to leave upon record to us the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in theſe two Syllogiſms; the ſame Spirit alſo works in us that Faith by which we are enabled to believe thoſe Scripture Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to be divine infallible truths; he alſo worketh in us every gracious habit, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeth thoſe gracious acts, which be the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and marks of our converſion, juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and title to glory; he alſo helpeth to feel and diſcover thoſe acts in our ſelves, and by comparing them with the rule, to find their ſincerity, which is his concurrence with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:52563:51"/> in making the aſſumption, and laſtly he helpeth ſanctified reaſon from the premiſes to inferr the Concluſion: whatever is beyond this is not eſſential to aſſurance, but ſomething ſeparable from it. Sometimes our aſſent to the premiſes and concluſion is ſtronger, ſometimes weaker; hence the different degrees of aſſurance; ſometimes upon this aſſurance &amp; peace of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, we are marvellouſly enlarged with conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, called joy in the holy Ghoſt, ſometimes nor.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Some may ſay, Is there no other way of working aſſurance but this? doth not God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times teſtifie without any ſuch diſcourſe and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination? hath he confined himſelf to Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſms? doth he not ſometimes make ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on us by which we are aſſured that we are the children of God, without the help or uſe of any argumentation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have been alway apt to think that there is no other ordinary way of aſſuring the ſoul, partly becauſe the Scripture no where encourageth us to look for aſſurance in any other way, and partly becauſe to grant an immediate teſtimony ſeemed to me to open ſuch a gap to <hi>Euthuſiaſme</hi> as it was impoſſible well to ſhut; and I am ſomewhat imboldned in that ſentiment by the concurrent judgment of a ſober judicious Divine, Mr. <hi>Tho. Blake,</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:52563:51"/> who in his Treatiſe of the Covenant thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth himſelf. <q>They that go about to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert an immediate teſtimony in any, will never ſecure the ſoul from deluſion; Sathan will ſoon find an artifice to counterfeit this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and bear witneſs in the Spirits ſtead; and when we think that we have the Spirit of truth to aſſure us, we ſhall have the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lies to deceive.</q> But in regard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of eminent piety and learning do aſſert an immediate teſtimony, it may not be amiſs to enquire a little what they mean by it, and how they do bound it, and then to ſhew what may be thought of it. By this immediate Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony they tell us, that they do not mean any proper whiſper or voice, ſuch as young Converts, miſtaking ſuch Scripture phraſes as <hi>Say unto my ſoul, thou art my ſalvation,</hi> are apt to wait for; but they ſay it is a perſwaſion impreſſed upon a man ſuddenly, and he knows not how, quieting all his doubts and fears, and making him chearfull and comfortable. If you ask them, How a Child of God, who is to try all things, dare adventure to take any ſuch comfort, how he knows it not to be a deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Satan? they tell us, that as there is in the eye a certain in-bred light, to make it diſcern light and colours without; a ſound and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52563:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> air within the ear, to make it diſcerne the ſounds without; So there is in a godly man grace, a new nature, and habitual inſtinct of heaven, whereby it diſcernes the conſolations of Gods Spirit teſtifying that he is the Son of God, ſome ſecret and inexpreſſible lineaments of the fathers countenance in the child, that the renewed ſoul at the very firſt bluſh knows, and owns it. Moreover they tell us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That although the Spirit thus teſtifie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out application of any particular word, yet he never teſtifies contrary to the word, he never ſpeaks to thoſe who are regenerate though they do not know themſelves to be ſuch.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Spirit doth not ordinarily thus teſtifie, but after or in attendance on ſome ordinance, or performance of ſome duty, or after ſome very great abaſement of a mans Spirit, and more then ordinary ſoul-humiliation, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome very hard adventure for God, or after ſome great combat and conflict with temptation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That ſuch of the Teſtimonies of the Spirit do beget but an actual aſſurance, during the preſent exigence, or in order to ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent deſign that God is working thereby.</p>
               <p>Now to give my ſenſe of this opinion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Authors of it ſeem ſo to bound it, as that it would be uncharitableneſs to think that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52563:52"/> they have any ill or pernicious deſign in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The things which they ſay are done by impreſſion, are not without ratiocination, only the ratiocination is not ſo diſtinct and explicite as when a man comes to his aſſurance by that difficult work of examination. Philoſophers ſay, that what is done by beaſts through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and impulſe, is not done without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing analogous to ratiocination; they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly give us the examples of ſuch Syllogiſms as they ſuppoſe to be made by beaſts, as namely lambs, when they come to their dams and flie away from the wolves. So I conceive, that in all the impreſſions made on the ſoul, whether they be by way of comfort or incitation to duty, there be ſome characters either in the matter or manner of them, either in their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, or greatneſs, or vehemence, or unuſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by which a Chriſtian knows them to be from God, and ſo accordingly reſts in them, the which characters did he not find, he would either not regard them, or reject them with abhorrence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I would not have any one lay the ſtreſs of his hope of heaven on any ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; nor upon the account of any ſuch impreſſion alter his opinion in reference to any point of Doctrine, or adventure upon any practice that is in the leaſt queſtionable unto
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52563:53"/> him. If he ſhould, I take it, he would give the devil great advantage againſt him, and ſubject himſelf to infinite deluſions, as will ſoon be manifeſt to him that will be at the pains to read over the diſcourſes of Dr. <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Moore</hi> concerning Enthuſiaſme. Mr. <hi>John Fox,</hi> our holy and learned Martyrologiſt, had many impreſſions, ſome of which are taken notice of by his ſon in the Hiſtory of his life; but did they not ſometimes fail him, and diſcover themſelves to be neither Divine nor True? Let any one judge by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the <hi>Revelations.</hi> He was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about that place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.5. Where it is ſaid, that <hi>the Beaſt had power to continue forty two months:</hi> after much prayer he had, though not a voice, yet, an impreſſion ſo ſtrong, that a voice from heaven could ſcarce have made him more confident, that he muſt count theſe months by Sabbaths, as <hi>Daniels</hi> weeks are counted by Sabbaths; he did ſo by the help of ſome Merchants, and found the years to be Two hundred ninety four, juſt the time of the ten firſt perſecutions, Doubtleſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith he, that was the time of the Beaſt. But who follows him in this? who almoſt, though he cannot confirm his own interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth not think himſelf able to overthrow this?</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:52563:53"/>4. The moſt ordinary and ſafe way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Aſſurance, is that I before mentioned, The diſcurſive way, in which a Believer from the fruits and effects of grace inferrs he hath the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and from the habit concludes his juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and adoption. This is proved,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe as it is a way leaſt ſubject to delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſo is it alſo moſt ſuited to a rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whoſe way of acting is by diſcourſe and argumentation: If any Probleme be propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Underſtanding which is not of it ſelf known and evident, the Underſtanding natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls to finding out ſome middle term or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which it may prove that the Predicate doth or doth not agree to the Subject; let any man whatever try, and he'l find he cannot do otherwiſe: And how little would be the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt a man and a beaſt, if a man ſhould aſſent to a thing unknown through an inſtinct and impreſſion, and ſhould to one who asks him a reaſon of his perſwaſion be able to return nothing in anſwer but this, <hi>I am perſwaded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am perſwaded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We muſt alſo make Chriſt to have put himſelf to a very unneceſſary expence, in inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring holy men to give unto us ſo many deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Grace, ſo many characters, by which the <hi>power of Godlineſſe</hi> may be known from the <hi>form,</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:52563:54"/> if we were not to come to the knowledge of our grace by making practical Syllogiſmes before mentioned.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor ſhould we ſo often and ſo earneſtly be called on to <hi>try and examine our ſelves, whether we be in the faith,</hi> if we were not to come to the knowledge of our faith in a diſcurſive way, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Effect to the Cauſe: Nor can we give a better reaſon, why our <hi>good works</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>fruits,</hi> then this, Becauſe as the Tree is known by its Fruits, (for <hi>a good tree cannot bring forth bad fruit, nor a bad tree good fruits</hi>) ſo the Heart by what proceeds from it, is known whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or evil.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We find the Saints in Scripture coming to their Aſſurance this way: <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of a good conſcience, that in godly ſincerity we have had our converſation in the world,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. His joy was founded on the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his Conſcience, but from what did his Conſcience teſtifie? from his ſincere converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith, henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> How plainly doth he here conclude his right to the Crown of Life from his having ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the terms of the Covenant of Grace? Nay, in Scripture we do find that men are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted

And the Rich, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17, 18, 19. are exhorted <hi>not to truſt in uncertain riches, but in the living God; to do good, to be rich in good works, ready to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute, willing to communicate;</hi> to what end? that they might <hi>lay up in ſtore for themſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, and lay hold of eternal life.</hi> The leaſt that can hence be inferred is, that good works are a foundation of evidence; or if any one diſlike the term <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> and ſhall chooſe rather, with <hi>Petit,</hi> to tranſlate, a <hi>Bill of contract,</hi> a <hi>Bond,</hi> or <hi>Obligation,</hi> it comes much to the ſame; for thence it will be eaſie to inferr, That he who is rich in good works, receives and layes up an Obligation from God, that this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:52563:55"/> of his ſhall have it's recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What need we go further then the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſtians? Do not all find that their Aſſurance is higher or lower, according as they can more or leſs diſcern the fruits of holineſs? When they are dead, lumpiſh, doth not Hope then fail or flag? And if any after back-ſliding be as confident of his eſtate as ever he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch back-ſliding, do we not think that mans Faith was Preſumption?</p>
               <p>Now of this that hath been ſaid concerning the way of attaining Aſſurance, ſeveral good Uſes may be made.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It confutes thoſe who condemn all uſe of Signs and Marks, aſſerting that we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to believe that God loves us with a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love. The late times, among many other ſad effects, produced or brought abroad ſundry who in their printed Pamphlets did make it a ſin to doubt, or once to enquire whether we be in Chriſt; ſaying, that we do never find that any in the courſe of Chriſt's or his Diſciples preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that did ask the queſtion, Whether they believed, or whether their faith were ſincere? But what if none did ask that queſtion then, muſt none ask it now? Are all the various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of troubled ſouls ſet down in particular
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:52563:55"/> examples in the New Teſtament? If any one had then doubted of the ſincerity of his graces, could he (unleſs ſome one had been preſent that had the gift of diſcerning ſpirits) have been cured of his doubts any other way then by examining himſelf by marks and ſigns? But doubtleſs there were then ſome who did doubt, or elſe the Apoſtle ſaw they had reaſon to doubt; for when he exhorts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf,</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Let every man prove his own work,</hi> none can rationally think his meaning was, Let a man take it for granted that his ſtate is good, and force himſelf into a perſwaſion that his work is acceptable to God; he that ſhould ſo do would neither have <hi>rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in himſelf alone, nor in another.</hi> But this evil ſpirit of <hi>Antinomianiſme</hi> is pretty well (bleſſed be God) laid, and I will not diſpute againſt it, leſt I ſhould raiſe it again; onely I judge it not unmeet to anſwer one Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> It may ſeem, that to take any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from our graces, is to receive humane witneſs to the things of God, which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I underſtand not but we may receive an humane teſtimony to witneſs the things of God, though the laſt reſolution of Divine Faith
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:52563:56"/> muſt be into Divine Veracity. But we need not enter into that diſpute for the anſwer of this objection; for our graces are not wrought in us by our own power, but by the power of God; and if they were, yet they are only the means by which our condition is known to us; the efficient cauſe of this knowledg is the Spirit illuſtrating our graces, and making them viſible, and enabling us to conclude from them.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Here's terror to all thoſe wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who perſwade themſelves that they are the Children of God, though they have in them none of the marks of the children of God. I know we are apt to be deceived by others, and much more <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to uſe St. <hi>James</hi> his word, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.22. to <hi>deceive,</hi> to put a fallacy on our ſelves. Yet a man would wonder how they who pretend to reaſon, ſhould be able ſo to impoſe on themſelves, or where they found the premiſes from which they inferre that concluſion that they are the children of God: Doth the Scripture any where ſay, that they who walk not after the Spirit, but after the fleſh, ſhall live? or that drunkards and ſwearers ſhall inherit the Kingdome of God? if the Scripture ſay not this, but the clean contrary, how come they then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe themſelves peace? Are they ſtill to learn
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:52563:56"/> that God is not ſuch a one as themſelves, or that they muſt be judged not according to the proverbs that paſs for current among men, but according to the law of liberty? Sith this law doth every where condemn them, how is it that their own Conſciences do not condemn them alſo? Is it not onely becauſe they do torture and wreſt the Scriptures, and ſo to bring them down to their own humor and fancies? But do they not do this to their own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? muſt not the great day of neceſſity ſhake, bring down this houſe, which hath no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but their own imaginations, exalting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the knowledg of God? Let all ſuch, if they be not as perfectly void of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe and reaſon as they be of Divine Faith, but conſider theſe Scriptures, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 8. <hi>Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reaps for he that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9, 10. <hi>Know ye not the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the Kingdome of God.</hi> Or if they will not hearken to the ſtiller voice of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:52563:57"/> let them yet hearken to the thunder of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.18, 19, 20, 21. <hi>Leſt there ſhould be a root among you that beareth gall and worm wood, and it come to paſſe when he heareth the words of this curſe, that he bleſſe himſelf in his heart, ſaying, I ſhall have peace, though I walk after the imagination of my heart to add drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to thirſt, the Lord will not ſpare him, but then the anger of the Lord and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoke againſt that man, and all the curſes that are written in this Book ſhall light on him, and the Lord ſhall blot out his name from under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Lord ſhall ſeparate him for evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Let all that fear God be perſwaded to make uſe of this way of getting Aſſurance, and not think to get it by I know not what Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical injections, or by going up and down with complaints againſt themſelves, but look for it in this way of trial and examination. Let not any one ſay, that the Writing of God is ſo blurred and blotted that he cannot tell what to make of it, the Waters ſo mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he deſpairs of ever ſeeing his face in them; for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If ſome ſigns be not viſible, others may, and they will ſuffice to lead thee to the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that thou art in the Bond of the Covenant; if thou canſt not take comfort in ſome Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:52563:57"/> yet there are others that will afford. If thou canſt not find Faith, yet canſt thou not deny but thou feareſt God, and trembleſt at his Word, why theſe are marks of a child of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. and ſo is a deſire to fear God, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.11. onely be ſure it be an earneſt, unwearied, induſtrious deſire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But if any man be under ſuch ſad dark temptations as that he can ſee no light at all, if he be confuſion all over, ſuch a one I adviſe not to examine; examination at ſuch a time is not a duty, but ſerves onely to breed further fears and uncertainties: In ſuch a caſe let a man put forth the firſt act of Faith, caſt himſelf on God, commit himſelf to him in well doing; he hath a command ſo to do, therefore he need not fear it will be an act of preſumption; he hath a promiſe if he do ſo that he ſhall be ſafe, let him therefore ſo do; and in continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſo to do, he ſhall, if by any way, come to find, that he hath laid hold on the Covenant, and that his condition before, though it was not comfortable, was ſafe, and known to God, though not to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 4. <hi>What's the reaſon why the children of God do want Aſſurance? or how comes it to paſſe that all who have grace do not preſently know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:52563:58"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is not one Queſtion, but two, and therefore without diſtinction no one thing can be replied to it. The word <hi>Reaſon</hi> (all one with cauſe) may either refer to the meritorious or final cauſe; either the meaning of the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, what are the gracious Intendments and Purpoſes of God in permitting his Children to want Aſſurance? or what are the ways by which they do ſinfully procure unto themſelves the want of Aſſurance. Of theſe I will ſpeak diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though, I take it, they are but rarely ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated: God doth not uſually let his ſervants be under darkneſs, but for ſin; and he would not permit them to fall into ſin, but that he hath an intent to make thoſe very falls, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments he inflicts becauſe of them, ſubſervient to his glory, and their good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1. Therefore enquire we why the Father of Lights ſuffers the Children of light to walk in darkneſs? why he ſets the ſeal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Spirit ſo obſcurely upon them, that they do not know themſelves to be ſealed with it to the day of redemption? eſpecially, ſeeing he doth hereby loſe a very great tribute of praiſe and glory? For how can they praiſe God for this though incomparable gift, if they know not themſelves to have received it? How can they rejoyce in the hope of glory, if they find
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52563:58"/> not in themſelves the Spirit, the onely ſeed and root of this hope.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This notwithſtanding, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers good reaſons why the Lord when he hath put grace into our hearts may yet not publiſh it in our conſciences. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If we ſpeak not of moderate, but of high Aſſurance, I think it is a wine too ſtrong for our weak heads, a wine too ſtrong for our veſſels to hold long; a glimpſe of it is enough to dazle the eye of the underſtanding; neither our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, nor our ſouls can long hold much of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens glory; conſult experience, and you'l find it ſo. <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> were upon the mount of Transfiguration, but they were then beſides themſelves, they knew not what they ſaid, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was wrapt up into the third Heavens, ſaw things that he could not utter; but the ſight tranſported him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were in the body, or out of the body, he could not tell, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3, 4. Some Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, eſpecially of the weaker ſex, being all affection, do too much ſlight a ſetled calm and peace of ſoul, as if it were little worth, falling upon ſuch paſſages as <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. <hi>Filled with all joy in believing; and rejoycing with joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. They think God hath forſaken them, and that they want
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:52563:59"/> faith, when they find not ſuch a ſugred joy and delight (as the judicious Mr. <hi>Richard Hooker</hi> ſitly calls it, <hi>pag.</hi> 546.) but to ſuch I ſay, they know not their own ſtrength; ſhould God ſo feaſt them continually, they would be leſs healthy and ſound, unfit for the duties of their ordinary particular callings and employments; too much honey (as it follows in the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>Ibid.</hi>) doth turn to gall, and too much joy, even ſpiritual, would make us wantons; yea, as the full ſpring tide is preparatory to a low ebb, ſo uſually theſe higheſt paſſionate joys do make way for, or at leaſt go before, the higheſt ſorrows and fears: therefore it is well, all things conſidered, that ſuch cordials are not made our diet, that ſuch ſuavities are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
               <p>But if we ſpeak even of <hi>Moderate Aſſurance,</hi> there be ſundry Reaſons that may move God to let his ſervants be without that, at leaſt, for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>To keep them from Relapſes.</hi> Should a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, after manifold foul miſcarriages, upon the firſt ſubmiſſion of his Son, receive him to Table, and entertain him with Paternal ſmiles, he would but encourage him to return to his former diſorderly converſation; but by keeping him at a diſtance, and returning into favour with him
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:52563:59"/> by degrees, he makes him more watchful. Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blably, if God, upon our firſt recovery from the ſins into which we have fallen, ſhould preſently pardon us, not onely in the Court of Heaven, but alſo in the Court of Conſcience; if he ſhould not onely pardon us, but alſo let us have the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of pardon, we might be apt to take up too ſlight thoughts of ſins guilt, and too eaſily run into the occaſions of it; but by letting us feel the ſmart and anguiſh of ſin, for days, months, years, he maketh us more watchful, he cauſeth us to make the ſtraighter paths unto our feet for ever after. <hi>David</hi> being left under the anguiſh of broken bones, under the quick and ſmart ſenſe of his Murder and Adultery, did more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after dread thoſe ſins, then ever did a burnt Child dread the fire: Let no man ſay, that it is a low and legal buſineſs to keep from ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of its bitterneſs; for though I grant that the love of God be the moſt perfect motive, yet it is not the moſt proper and powerful, for thoſe who are fleſh as well as ſpirit: and I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, the moſt refined Chriſtians, had they not either felt the ſmart of ſin themſelves, or conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with thoſe that had, would make too many bold adventures on the patience, forbearance, and long-ſufferance of God. <hi>After all this is come on us for our evil deeds, aod for our great

               <p n="2">2. <hi>To keep them Humble.</hi> For though times of Aſſurance ſhould be times of Humility, yet few are of ſo ſtrong a grace as to be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſo great an happineſs: Pride will not ſooner breed in any thing then in thoſe ſweet conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Spirit of God, aſſuring us of our intereſt in the Promiſes; that viſion of God which is apt in its own nature to make the ſoul abhor it ſelf in duſt and aſhes, <hi>Job</hi> 42.5, 6. doth, through the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in us, but puff it up. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> had been in the third Heavens, enjoying Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to an hyperbole, God then thinks meet to buffet him with the Meſſenger of Sathan: after ſuch extraordinary Viſion of God, he was ready to look on himſelf rather as an Angel, then as fleſh and blood: therefore was there given him a <hi>thorn in the fleſh.</hi> He had either ſome very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent temptation to ſome fleſhly luſt, or ſome other very piercing tryal; and he tells us twice in one verſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. that this befel him, <hi>leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure.</hi> Alſo when <hi>Moſes</hi> had been in the Mount, and had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a luſtre by converſing with God, 'tis ſo ordered, that at the very foot of the Mount he meets with ſomething to humble him, and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:52563:61"/> take him down; <hi>Thy people have made a golden Calf:</hi> then which, no words could poſſibly have more cut his heart. Our Saviour who vouchſafed to be tempted like unto us in all things, was then led of the Spirit into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs to be tempted of the Devil, when he had juſt heard the voyce, <hi>This is my well-belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi> Matth. 3.17.4.1. <q>Happier a great deal is that mans caſe, whoſe ſoul by inward deſolation is humbled, then he, whoſe heart is through abundance of ſpiritual delight lifted up, and exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meaſure. Better it is ſometimes to go down into the Pit with him, who behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing darkneſs, and bewailing the loſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joy and conſolation, cryeth from the bottom of the loweſt Hell, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to walk arm in arm with Angels, to ſit, as it were, in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, and to have no thought, no cogitation, but <hi>I thank my God, it is not with me as with others:</hi> ſaith the learned <hi>Hooker,</hi> pag. 546.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. God may hide his face from his ſervants, and let them be in dark, <hi>to make them the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt in their prayers and ſupplications.</hi> As a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, Fathers do hide themſelves that their Children may ſeek after them, and purpoſely

None more ſervent, none more frequent in prayers, then they who did once live in the light of Gods countenance, and have loſt it: Read but the Pſalmes of <hi>David,</hi> penned by him when he was in any deſertion, you'l think that he breathed out his ſoul with his petitions; ſuch an <gap reason="foreign">

And cannot ſome of you tell me, how, when you have been in fears about your condition, you have been all Prayer? have you not even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied your ſelves the time you were forced to ſpend in eating and in drinking? Have not your hearts been ſo full, that you have been fain to creep into a corner, and pour out your ſouls in complaints? For my part, I have ſcarce known any, who for prayer have been able to keep company with thoſe who have been at a loſs about their eternal eſtate.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God may hide, <hi>for the tryal and exerciſe of his peoples Graces.</hi> As there would be no uſe of Candles if there were no night, no uſe of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:52563:62"/> Cordials if no ſwooning, ſo would there be either none at all, or but very little uſe of ſome Graces, were it not for hidings and withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Gods gracious preſence: Faith, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Courage, would not be much put to it, if God ſhould alway ſmile on thoſe who fear him; nor would their obedience, in compariſon, be praiſe-worthy: if when God looks more like an enemy then a friend, we can then wait and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him, then is our faith faith indeed, our love love indeed. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.12. <hi>Here is the patience of the Saints; here are they that keep the Commandments of God, and the faith of Jeſus:</hi> here Faith and Patience do ſhew themſelves.

               <p n="5">5. God may permit one to want Aſſurance, <hi>that he may the more value it when he hath it.</hi> What ſticks a little, and comes not till after much ſeeking, and manifold prayers, is uſually moſt prized and valued when we have it. Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

Should Aſſurance come with thoſe weak wiſhes and velleities that are ſo frequent in the mouths of many, we might then ſet no more by the light of Gods countenance, then we do by corn, wine, and oyl: as in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, ſo in ſpirituals, we learn to eſtimate our mercies more by wanting, then by enjoying them.</p>

God may let ſome want comfort, <hi>That they may be the more able to comfort others.</hi> Should their mountain alway ſtand firm, ſhould God conſtantly ſmile on them, and kiſs them with the kiſſes of his mouth, and make known unto them the moſt ſecret treaſures of his goodneſs, how little compaſſion would they ſhew to over-clouded deſerted ſouls? They would do by them, as did the Watchmen by the Spouſe, ſmite and wound them, inſtead of comforting them; they might quench the ſmoaking flax, break the bruiſed reed; ſay, as ſome have done, that not the faith of adherence, but aſſurance, doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie:

Chriſt was tempted like unto us in all things, even in point of deſertion, for he cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> and wherefore was he ſo tempted, but <hi>that he might be able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour thoſe that are tempted?</hi> Heb. 2.18.

God may permit his Servants to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſenſe of his love <hi>with relation to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> that his glory may the more appear: His power is more manifeſted in preſerving his Saints without then with Aſſurance. When <hi>Paul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought the Lord thrice that the meſſenger of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan might depart from him, his ſuit is not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, onely this anſwer is returned, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee, for my ſtrength is perfected in thy weakneſſe:</hi> whence he reſolves, <hi>Moſt gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may reſt on me,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. Indeed, ſo vaſt a diſproportion is there betwixt the joys of Heaven, and the carnal pleaſures of this World, that ſhould a Chriſtian alway have aſſurance of his title to the former, it would not be much wondred at if he deſpiſed the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but herein the power of Gods grace is ſeen, that he brings a man into the ſtrict deſpiſed ways of holineſs, with a reſolution, <hi>if he periſh, there to periſh;</hi> that he keeps him from the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions that are in the world through luſt, even
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:52563:65"/> when he doubts whether he ſhall have a portion among thoſe that are ſanctified. Herein is ſeen the power of the Devil, not that he keepeth men captive, whileſt he hath honours and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to beſtow on them; but that he can make them to hold faſt their ſins, when Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have laid hold of them in their ſins. God ſpeaketh of ſuch not without ſome admiration, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.6. <hi>I have ſmitten you thus and thus, yet have ye not returned unto me, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And he ſets a brand of infamy on <hi>Ahaz, becauſe be ſinned yet more in the day of his diſtreſſe,</hi> 2 Chron. 28.22. Likewiſe the power of God is then moſt manifeſt, when he makes any to hold their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in the midſt of tentation and oppoſition. Every Chriſtian is the workmanſhip of God created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works; but in none doth his eternal power ſo evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as in ſuch: God doth even boaſt of ſuch, <hi>Job</hi> 2.3. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto Satan, Haſt thou not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered my ſervant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and upright man, one that feareth God and eſcheweth evil; and ſtill he holdeth faſt his integrity, although thou mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedſt me againſt him to deſtroy him without cauſe.</hi> And as his power appears in preſerving them in their low condition, ſo doth his patience in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all their froward and paſſionate thoughts
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:52563:65"/> and ſpeeches during deſertion, and his mercy and goodneſs in bringing them from under it. Iſa. 41.17. <hi>When the poor and needy ſeek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirſt, I the Lord will hear them, I the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>will not forſake them: I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midſt of vallies, that they may ſee, and know, and conſider, and underſtand together, that the hand of the Lord hath done this, and the holy One of</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath created it.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The anſwer to this is wholly to be made up of particular obſervations and experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are ſo many and various, that I reckon it next to impoſſible to put them into order: as for the more common ſinful lets and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Aſſurance, they have been ſo fully and clearly handled by ſo many already in print, that if I were not tied up by promiſe to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about them, I might paſs them over in ſilence, or content my ſelf to paraphaſe on ſome Scriptures in <hi>Job,</hi> the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> relating to this head; but the laws of method calling me to ſay ſomething to this part of the queſtion alſo, I ſhall ſo do, but yet briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The ſmalneſs and littleneſs of ſome mens graces is the cauſe why they do want Aſſurance.</hi> The
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52563:66"/> Kingdom of God within them being but as a grain of <hi>Muſtardſeed,</hi> which is the <hi>leaſt of all</hi> ſeeds, 'tis no wonder they ſee it not, the root of the matter being but ſmall, and covered over with many ſinful infirmities, 'tis not ſtrange that they are not ſenſible of it. I muſt not ſo far contradict experience, as to ſay that God doth never make the time of converſion, when grace is comparatively but ſmall, a time of ſealing; he did ſo uſually in the firſt preaching of the Goſpel; for then men comming out of groſs darkneſs into marvellous light, and turning from ſerving dumb Idols to ſerve the living God; their change muſt needs be of eaſier obſervation then it is now, when perſons having ſucked in Chriſtian Religion with their mothers milk, turn onely from a careleſs, to a more diligent way of ſerving the true God: And beſides, Religion had then nothing to commend it to mens affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but onely its own beauty and lovelineſs; but now that <hi>Kings and Queens vouchſafe to be unto it nurſing fathers; and nurſing mothers,</hi> we cannot have ſo little ground of ſuſpecting our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincerity as might they, who did no ſooner make confeſſion of Chriſt, but they became <hi>the filth and off-ſcouring of all things.</hi> Yea, even in theſe days, it pleaſeth God ſometimes, after great legal humiliations, to let in ſome hope whileſt
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:52563:67"/> grace is but low, leſt his creature ſhould be ſwallowed up of ſorrow: However, uſually a little faith, as to any ſetled laſting comfort, is as no faith, and time with weak Chriſtians is more profitably ſpent in multiplying thoſe acts which may ſtrengthen the habit, then in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring whether it be already ſincere: habits cannot of themſelves be felt, but they diſcover themſelves by their actions; and weak habits put forth ſuch faint actions, and with ſo much interruption, that it cannot eaſily be known whether they be the fruits of common or ſpecial grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But cannot the Spirit of God ſo irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate the very leaſt meaſure of grace, as to make it viſible, and ſo the ground of Aſſurance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No queſtion, the Spirit can ſo do; but we now enquire not what he can do, but what he uſually doth: and this may ſafely be ſaid, that Gods Spirit doth not uſually witneſs to thoſe who have attained to the leaſt meaſure of ſaving grace, and muſt neceſſarily by their frequent failings and tranſgreſſions make much work for an accuſing conſcience: nor indeed do I ſee, that it would be for the advantage of leſs obedient and exact Chriſtians, to have Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; rather it might beget in them ſecurity and pride, ſins to which novices are prone.</p>

               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Doth not this put the poor newly converted Chriſtian into continual doubts and fears, and ſtrike at the very root of all his hopes and comforts?</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We are not creators of comfort, but onely diſpenſers; we cannot make an eaſier or ſpeedier way to Aſſurance then Chriſt hath made, nor can we approve of, or ſo much as excuſe thoſe who do ſnatch at comfort before they be meet for it. It is ſufficient, that we can aſſure all, that Chriſt hath purchaſed remiſſion of ſin for them, upon his own terms, the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him as Prophet, Prieſt, King, and that all who repent are juſtified in the ſight of God, though not juſtified in their own conſciences; and that in due ſeaſon their own conſciences ſhall juſtifie them alſo; and that Chriſt will not <hi>break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax;</hi> and that it cannot be that the merciful God ſhould condemn thoſe who tremble at his Word, and lie at his feet, enquiring the Law at his mouth, and grieved at nothing more then that they cannot yield perfect and compleat obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Another Reaſon why ſo many want Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, is becauſe <hi>they ſeek not for it with ſo much diligence as a matter of that nature requires.</hi> Some little pains they will take to find out the marks of ſincerity, and ſome little time they will ſpend in comparing their hearts with thoſe marks; but they will not continue the great du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſelf-examination till the matter be brought
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:52563:68"/> to ſome iſſue; they will not behold their faces in the glaſs long enough to beget in themſelves a true notion or Idea of themſelves, but go away and preſently forget what manner of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they were. How few are there whom we can perſwade at a night to catechize their own ſouls, to criticize on the actions of the day paſt? How few that can be prevailed with to ſpend any conſiderable proportion of time in Cloſet devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? yet better may we expect eminent skill in the moſt abſtruſe Arts and Sciences without great labour, then expect Aſſurance without all morally poſſible ſedulity. Wherefore, the <hi>rather give diligence to make your calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. <hi>Give the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> ſo the Old Tranſlation. Indeed, the making of calling and election ſure doth deſerve all diligence, and require all diligence; it is not a little diligence that will ſerve to find out the manifold ſubtilties of a deceitfull heart, nor a little diligence that will fruſtrate the devices of Satan, who will not fail to joyn himſelf with carnal reaſon, and to beget in us hard thoughts of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1, 2. <hi>O God, thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee: My ſoul thirſteth for thee my fleſh longeth for thee, in a dry and thirſty land, where no water is; To ſee thy power and thy glory, ſo as I have ſeen thee in the ſanctuary.</hi> Like care and deſire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:52563:69"/> the Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> to recover the ſight, and to her apprehenſion, loſt love of Chriſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If this be ſo, What ſhall become of thoſe that are poor in the world, who have but little time to ſpare from the duties of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular calling, either for the reading of the Word, or communing with their own hearts? Can none of theſe have a ſenſe of Gods love? muſt they perpetually lie under doubts and fears about their eternal ſtate?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God forbid I ſhould ſo ſay, <hi>God hath choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the Kingdom, which he hath promiſed to them that love him,</hi> Jam. 2.5. But there is no good man ſo poor, but he will find out ſome conſiderable proportion of time to mind the ſtate of his ſoul in: God giveth unto all ſuch a contented mind, which makes them they do not deſire much, nor make haſte to be rich; he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth unto them alſo wiſdom and prudence, by which they can husband their opportunities ſo as to keep themſelves from beggary, and yet give as many viſits unto God as they do that have abundance. Beſides, what our Lord Chriſt determined in the caſe of the Widow, that the <hi>two mites ſhe threw into the treaſury, was more then the much caſt in by the rich, becauſe they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:52563:69"/> did caſt in of their abundance, but ſhe of her want did cast in all that ſhe had, even all her living, Mar.</hi> 12.43, 44. holds true here alſo: the poor mans hour is more then the rich mans two hours, becauſe his hour is all that he can tell how to redeem from the neceſſities of nature and relations, and therefore he ſhall be ſo bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and aſſiſted by God in that hour, that he ſhall reap as many comfortable fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as thoſe who can ſpare a far greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Some do want Aſſurance through the ignorance that is in them,</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the faith, prove your own ſelves; Know ye not that Chriſt is in you except ye be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, void of judgment.</hi> 'Tis onely for them <hi>that are of full age, that by reaſon of uſe have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern betwixt good and evil,</hi> Heb. 5.14. therefore the Apoſtle prayeth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.9. <hi>That their love might abound more and more in knowledg, and in all judgment, that they might approve things that are excellent,</hi> or that they might <hi>diſcern things that differ,</hi> as it is in the margin of our preſent tranſlation, and in the text of the former: let but any diſcourſe with the generality of troubled Chriſtians, he ſhall find that many of their doubts had never been, if when they had firſt given themſelves up to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52563:70"/> God, they had then alſo given themſelves up to ſome judicious and pious Paſtor, that would have been at pains well to inſtruct them in the Articles of Religion, in the firſt principles of the Oracles of God: ſome miſtakes they ſucked in when firſt they began to be ſerious, which made them ever after to fear where no fear was. <hi>Had their eye been ſingle, their whole body had been full of light; but their eye being evil, their whole body was full of darkneſs, and they could never know whither they went.</hi> Three errors eſpecially I have obſerved ſome unskilful <hi>in the word of righteouſneſs</hi> to have ſucked in, which have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned unto them much perplexity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Error hath been <hi>about the terms and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of grace:</hi> they make more neceſſary to their acceptation with God, then God ever made; though <hi>their hearts be prepared to ſeek the Lord God of their fathers,</hi> yet <hi>becauſe they are not cleanſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary;</hi> though their works are done in ſincerity, yet becauſe they have not been found by them to be full and perfect, therefore have they drawn ſad and dreadful concluſions againſt themſelves: Ask them whether they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truth of the Goſpel, and whether they do not heartily conſent that Chriſt ſhould be theirs, and they his, they dare not deny it; yet
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52563:70"/> will they not be comforted, becauſe they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe faith to be quite another thing, a firm per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that they are already juſtified. Ask them whether it be not their hearty and earneſt deſire and endeavour to obey the whole Law of Chriſt, they'l anſwer, they hope it is, and yet put away from themſelves all the comforts and priviledges of the Covenant, becauſe they find in themſelves many ſinful ſuggeſtions of the fleſh, or becauſe it is not with them as it is with ſome others: as if the condition of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant were perfect and unſinning obedience, and not ſincere obedience; or as if all Gods children were of the ſame ſize and ſtature. Hence ſad dreadful complaints are made by men, that they do not believe, nor obey Chriſt, when yet it is manifeſt they do believe and obey, onely they are miſtaken in their notion about the nature of Faith and Evangelical obedience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A conceit, <hi>That all who are converted, muſt needs know when they were converted,</hi> and by what means, and how they were converted; whereas with ſome, <hi>The Kingdom of God is as if a man ſhould caſt ſeed into the ground, and ſhould ſleep, and riſe day and night, and the ſeed ſhould ſpring and grow up he knoweth not how,</hi> Mar. 4.26, 27. As for knowing the time of Converſion, I am ſo far from judging it to be neceſſary to all
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:52563:71"/> Chriſtians, that I think it is in an ordinary way impoſſible to any Chriſtian: Thoſe indeed whoſe lives have been ſtained with enormous crimes do uſually know when they firſt began to be reclaimed, and what were <hi>the thorns with the which their ways firſt were hedged up;</hi> but how they ſhould know what was the <hi>Ultimum non eſſe</hi> of the Old Man, and the <hi>Primum eſſe</hi> of the New Man; how they ſhould underſtand the nick of time in which they ceaſed to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and began to be ſpiritual, without ſome ſuch aſſiſtance as is not uſual, I conceive not. Yet even in this particular a <hi>deluded heart hath turned ſome aſide, ſo that they cannot deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſay, Is there not a lie in my right hand?</hi> Men could not be held long in ſuch a ſnare as this, if they did not pin their Judgments on the ſleeves of ſome well meaning Teachers, all whoſe dictates they ſwallow without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Some are hugely tormented <hi>becauſe they miſtake themſelves about the way of working Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, and about the nature of Aſſurance:</hi> They have thought that Aſſurance is wrought by ſome vocal, or as it were vocal teſtimony of the Spirit, which is not ordinarily the way of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Aſſurance; and they think, that ſo ſoon as they be aſſured they muſt needs be void of all
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:52563:71"/> fears, and filled with all joy in believing: hence, when they have Aſſurance, yet they complain they want it; but this is a miſtake, for glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and raviſhing Joy is a ſeparable accident from Aſſurance; nor yet doth Aſſurance exclude all doubting and fear, but onely ſuch doubting and fear as ariſeth from infidelity and reigning hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Some are kept from Aſſurance, <hi>becauſe they do keep the Devils counſel, and bury thoſe doubts and fears about their condition in their own boſoms,</hi> which they ought to diſcover unto others. This is moſtly the condition of thoſe who are peſtered with the <hi>horribilia de Deo,</hi> buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted with blaſphemous thoughts, or with temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to uncleanneſs, theſe diſhonourable loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome workings of ſoul they are unwilling to make known: hence <hi>they are like unto the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſea that cannot reſt, but is continually caſting up its mire and dirt.</hi> If Women when in their pangs ſhould not ſend for the Midwife to deliver them, how few would not miſcarry? If Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents ſhould never have recourſe unto their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to ſolve their doubts, how little would be their proficience? And muſt not they who will not make uſe of the help and aſſiſtance of their ſpiritual Guides and Teachers, go much about, and ſtay longer under bondage, and in the place
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:52563:72"/> of bringing forth of children then they needed elſe to do? There are ſome, <hi>to whom God hath given the tongue of the learned, that they may ſpeak a word in due ſeaſon to him that is weary, Iſa.</hi> 50.4. ſome whom <hi>God hath comforted, to the end they may comfort others with the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations wherewith they themſelves have been comforted,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.4. ſome to whom it is ſaid, <hi>Receive ye the Holy Ghoſt; whoſe ſins ye remit they are remitted, and whoſe ſoever ſins ye retain they are retained,</hi> Joh. 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23.24. Theſe God will have owned and honoured, not by confeſſing to them all the ſins of our lives, but by opening to them ſuch doubts as God ſeems to deny us ſatisfaction to upon our own private prayers and endeavours; for not doing this, many are kept a great while on the rack, that elſe might ſoon find eaſe and relief. The Spouſe in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> ch. 3. verſ. 3, 4. after ſhe had enquired of the Watchmen, <hi>Whether they had ſeen him whom ſhe loved,</hi> had not paſſed farr but ſhe found him. But then perſons muſt make conſcience of dealing plainly and truly with thoſe who do watch over their ſouls: which I do therefore ſuggeſt, becauſe it is too uſual with thoſe that are troubled, not faithfully to relate where the ſhooe pincheth them, but with the Lapwing to make the greateſt noiſe when they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52563:72"/> are furtheſt off from the neſt. <hi>Moſes</hi> was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that God ſhould think of ſending him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and he would needs make as if his ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering uneloquent tongue were the cauſe of his loathneſs to go about that meſſage, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.10. but the truth was, <hi>Moſes</hi> had killed an Egyptian, and he was afraid leſt if he ſhould go back into <hi>Egypt,</hi> there might be there who would require blood for blood; and therefore when God had ſatisfied him, <hi>That all the men were dead who ſought his life,</hi> verſ. 19. he takes his wife and children, and without more ado ſets himſelf to return to the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">V. Some do keep themſelves under doubts and fears <hi>by joyning themſelves to unmeet compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> There are that be carnal and ſenſual, the diſcourſe of ſuch muſt needs be to ſuch as are in trouble, but as the continual dropping of rain on ſmoaking flax. 2. There be ſome godly Miniſters who have ſo accuſtomed themſelves to breath out thunder and lightning, that if they ſhould be reſorted to, they would with the Watchmen in the <hi>Canticles</hi> wound the love-ſick Spouſe, whom they ought to pity and comfort. 3. There be alſo who daub with untempered morter; who in order to comfort, deliver ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings worthy of all manner of acceptation, but not faithful and true: How profitable are ſound
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52563:73"/> words? But what do the arguings of ſuch men avail? They will not do ſo much good while they are ſuppoſed to have a foundation in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as they muſt needs do miſchief when they are upon examination found to be built on the ſands. 4. There be alſo who do love in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and companies to be ſpeaking of their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to be telling what great things they have done for God, and God for them; of ſuch I could ſcarce ever bring my ſelf to have any charitable opinion; for though a good man may ſometimes lawfully glory, yet will he never do ſo, but when he is by unavoidable neceſſity put upon it ſo to do, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1, 11. But I liſt not now to diſpute the lawfulneſs or unlawfulneſs of commending a mans ſelf; expedient doubtleſs it is, not to glory before thoſe who have the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the Almighty ſticking in them; rather we ſhould ſpeak to ſuch of the infirmities we have felt, or do feel, leſt we ſhould diſcourage them. 5. But that company which troubled clouded ſouls do moſt affect, (and yet which is as dangerous unto them as any) is the company of ſuch as are as much dejected as themſelves; but as drunkard did never grow ſober by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with drunkards, nor ignorant perſons ever grow more knowing by communion with thoſe who were no wiſer then themſelves, ſo
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:52563:73"/> nor can deſponding Chriſtian grow more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable by joyning himſelf to ſuch as are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſt down with himſelf; nay, by ſuch means troubles are inſenſibly increaſed, fears multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and hard thoughts begotten of God who is grace and love. Converſe in ſuch caſes ſhould be with thoſe whoſe conſciences do make them a continual feaſt, who are ſober and judicious, and will handle a broken or diſ-joynted bone with the ſpirit of meekneſs, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1. who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ignorant of Satans devices, will ſee that they be not overwhelmed with ſorrow, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7, 11.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. A <hi>perverſe, diſputing, quarrelling, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing humor, hinders many from Aſſurance.</hi> The breaſts of Conſolation do then ſatisfie when we put them to our mouths and ſuck at them; the Word of Promiſe doth profit us when it is mixed with Faith. If in ſtead of receiving of it believingly, and meditating on it delightfully, we put it away from us as not belonging to us, no ſupport ſhall we receive from it. Whileſt the unregenerate condition continueth, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will aſſiſt men what he can to thruſt by and put off any thing that might beget in them the leaſt diſtruſt of themſelves; but when they are once begotten again by the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the dead, he will beſtir himſelf as
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:52563:74"/> much as may be to make them pauſe upon one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which is apt to cauſe fear and bondage, and not once to mind any thing that hath the leaſt tendency to comfort and quiet them. Thus was it with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 77.2. <hi>My ſore runs in the night ſeaſon, my ſoul refuſed to be comforted.</hi> Never had Moderator in the Schools more ado to ſtop the mouth of a wrangling Sophiſter, then Miniſters uſually have to ſilence the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of ſome people againſt themſelves; they ſeem to have ſearched the Devils whole Armory, to find out weapons to fight againſt their own peace; not one place of Scripture ſounding terrour, but they have it in a readineſs; not any one harſh expreſſion ever dropped from the pen or lip of any eminent Divine in order to the awakening of ſleepy ſinners, but they have it at their fingers end, and will urge and plead it to the full. <q>Read the ſpeeches of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſouls recorded in Scripture, eſpecially <hi>Job</hi> and the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> you will eaſily obſerve there is ſomething more then ordinary Rhetorick in them; and he that ſhall deal with any ſuch now, ſhall alſo find it ſo; yea, he ſhall find them in ſome matters, to reaſon above and beyond their natural parts, ſo as one can ſcarcely need any other argument to confirm him that there is a Devil, who hath but heard and impartially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:52563:74"/> of their arguings. He that writes the Life of <hi>Francis Spira</hi> tells us, with what ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and wonderful ſophiſtry he diſcourſed againſt the pardonableneſs of his ſins, and poſſibility of his ſalvation. <hi>Mirâ ſagacitate ad ſingula reſpondebat, quaecunque adferebantur torquebat, agebatque in contrariam partem mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâ violentiâ argumentorum &amp; admirando orationis impetu. Nihil potuit adeo apte propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, nihil tam accommodate adferri, quod non ille vel refelleret argutiſsime, vel eluderet calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſsime, vel diſſolveret promptiſsime, ſaepe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra meipſum cogitavi, eum nequaquam fuiſſe it a perſpicacem in judicio dogmatum, ita porro exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citatum in diſputationibus Theologicis cum eſſet ſanus,</hi> are ſome of the Hiſtorians words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, <hi>pag.</hi> 20, 21. <hi>Spira</hi>'s caſe may be thought to have ſomething peculiar in it, but I have obſerved a like ſagacity in ſome of ordinary parts, whom none not void of charity would not have thought to be good men: the which as I can in part aſcribe to that diſtemper of body which doth accompany ſoul-trouble, ſo I think he that ſhould aſcribe it to that only, and not at all to the evil ſpirit, (who loves to fiſh in troubled waters, and to joyn himſelf as an aſſiſting forme to him that ſets himſelf to war againſt himſelf,) would rather ſhew
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52563:75"/> himſelf an Infidel, then a Philoſopher.</q> Nay, it is not unuſual with them to libel and bear falſe witneſs againſt themſelves, to lay ſuch things to their own charge as they were never guilty of, on purpoſe to hinder thoſe who have to deal with them from giving them any comfort, on purpoſe to make them alter the frame of their diſcourſe: Can it be wondred that ſuch as theſe go mourning and hanging down their heads all their days? if they will needs ſhut up all doors of hope that are opened to them, can it ſeem marvellous, that they are troubled, and ſuffered to deſpair everlaſtingly?</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Many are kept from Aſſurance <hi>through groundleſs irrational ſcruples, cauſing them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the uſe of Ordinances, and other ſanctified means in which Aſſurance is uſually wrought.</hi> Would a ſick man ever recover health that ſhould be afraid of Phyſick? or a weak man e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recover ſtrength that ſhould abſtain from the good wholeſom food that is appointed to beget blood and ſpirits? Why, no more will they ever meet with God, or enjoy the ſenſe of his love, who come not near the place where his honour dwelleth; they muſt needs be in the dark, who will not open their eyes to behold the Sun of Righteouſneſs; needs be in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual thirſt, who will not draw water out of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:52563:75"/> wells of ſalvation to quench their thirſt. Yet how many are afraid to come to the fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are cold, and to put on their clothes becauſe they are naked, or to come to the Phyſician becauſe they are ſo extreamly ſick. Tell them they muſt pray; they'l anſwer, no, becauſe being wicked, their prayers muſt needs be an abomination to the Lord; invite them to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, they'l tell you, that finding not themſelves to be in Chriſt, they ſhould but eat and drink judgment to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: put them upon hearing the Word preached, then they have ſomething to object againſt either the call, or the life of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Such ſcruples as theſe are the Thieves that do waſt <hi>the Candle of the Lord,</hi> the Worms that eat up <hi>the hidden Manna,</hi> the Veils that hide the <hi>new Name</hi> from our eyes. A Conſcience truly tender is the fitteſt ſubject to receive the ſeal of the Spirit, but a ſcrupulous Conſcience is a very hell upon earth; for it either quite takes a man from the direct immediate acts of Gods Worſhip and Service, or elſe it confines him onely to ſuch, keeping him from the duties of his particular calling. It is hard to ſay which extream is more dangerous; the one ſtarving, the other ſurfeiting the Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But can any one give God too much
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:52563:76"/> time, or be too Religious and careful about his Soul?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Surely no; he cannot have too much of our time, unto whom all our time is due; nor can any one have too much of that which is his happineſs, or be too careful about that, which if he ſhould loſe, nothing can be given in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for; but yet it is poſſible for us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow too much time on ſome one part of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and we do ſo, as oft as we ſuffer it to juſtle out all, or any of the reſt. The works of our Callings are the ſervice of God, when done in obedience to his Command, and with an eye to his glory; and for them, when ſo done, we may from the Lord expect to receive a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: and therefore when the Devil <hi>transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf into an Angel of light</hi> ſuggeſts, What wilt thou eat or drink, card or ſpin, ſtudy any humane Author, when thou knoweſt not but thou maiſt be in Hell the next moment? He muſt be anſwered, That obeying God ſets no one nearer Hell: and that though praying be in it ſelf better then any either natural or civil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet he that commanded it, commanded them alſo, and therefore they alſo are in their ſeaſon to be done. The Devil hath that ſoul at advantage enough, whom he can perſwade either not to pray, or to do nothing but pray.</p>
               <p n="8">
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:52563:76"/>VIII. <hi>The greateſt and moſt common cauſe of the want of Aſſurance, is ſome unmortified luſt,</hi> ſome ſecret boſome corruption unto which men give entertainment, or at leaſt which they do not ſo vigorouſly oppoſe, and heartily renounce as they might, <hi>Hinc illae lachrymae,</hi> this is that which caſts them on ſore ſtraights and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; how ſhould it be otherwiſe, ſeeing God being infinitely wiſe and holy, either cannot, or will not reveal his ſecrets to thoſe, who har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour his known enemies in their boſome; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot or will not regard the whinings and complainings of thoſe who dally with that very ſin which galls their conſciences, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at the ſtirrings of that very luſt for which he hides his face from them? Doth any one come to his Miniſter, or to his Chriſtian friends, and ſay, Is it peace? they muſt all anſwer, What peace, ſo long as thou liveſt in commiſſion of any known ſin, or omiſſion of any known duty? All doubts and fears are begotten upon ſin, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther real or imaginary; if the ſin be but imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, a rectified judgment may ſcatter the doubts and fears as the Sun doth miſts; if the ſin be real, no curing the doubts thence ariſing, but by an unfeigned repentance. If I would produce all the Scriptures that prove this, I muſt tranſcribe the one half of the Bible: but
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52563:77"/> it would be needleſs ſo to do, ſeeing it ſeemeth to have been a notion engraven even on natural conſcience, That ſin ſo defiles perſons, that till they be waſhed from it neither they nor their ſervices can be accepted; from whence aroſe the cuſtome of ſetting Water-pots at their entrance into their Temples or places of Worſhip; and thoſe phraſes, <hi>Eo lavatum ut ſacrificem,</hi> and <hi>Num lavabis ut rem divinam facias?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. 5. <hi>What are the Motives or Arguments by which we may quicken our ſelves to look after this ſealing work of the holy Spirit of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is there any need of Arguments to excite us to this Duty? Doth not the New Creature naturally pant after Aſſurance <hi>as the Hart panteth after the rivers of water?</hi> Yea, may not the rational Soul ſeem to deſire it? Do not all wicked men catch after certainty, and frame unto themſelves ſome kind of certainty? in this onely miſerable, that they either build on a falſe principle, or on a true principle falſly applied. To doubt of happineſs is an heavy burthen, but to fear extremeſt miſery, that is intolerable; and yet thus muſt every one do till he have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſſurance, or thoſe probable hopes that are next of kin to Aſſurance. Shall worldlings do ſo much to ſecure their Lands, Goods, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52563:77"/> ſhall they require Bonds, Seals, Oaths, Sureties, and yet think all too little, and ſhall we count any thing too much to aſſure unto our ſelves the eternal condition of our poor ſouls? In the fear of the Lord let it be conſidered,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>'Tis onely the aſſured Chriſtian that can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſire, or ſo much as adventure in cool blood to die;</hi> all others muſt needs all their life time be in continual bondage through fear of death. Tell not me, that ſome wicked ruffling Gallants, who neither have Aſſurance, nor are in any near capacity to receive it, are yet very prodigal of their lives; for I am ſpeaking of men, and not of brutes; of thoſe who are guided by Reaſon, and not by Senſe; of thoſe who are convinced that their Souls are immortal, and that it is their greateſt folly and miſery to loſe them, not of thoſe who have baniſhed all thoughts of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, and look not on Death as an inlet to Eternity; the inſtance of theſe monſters therefore notwithſtanding, I ſay onely the (in ſome degree) aſſured Chriſtian can chearfully look the Prince of Terrors in the face, onely he can triumph over this laſt Enemy: Not onely <hi>the ſinners in Sion are afraid, fearfulneſs doth</hi> not onely <hi>ſurprize the hypocrite,</hi> but alſo the ſincere Chriſtian, in ſo far as he doth not know himſelf to be ſuch. With what ſhiverings muſt
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52563:78"/> they needs enter into the <hi>chambers of darkneſſe,</hi> who do not know but that they may lead them into <hi>outer darkneſſe?</hi> How unwillingly muſt the Soul needs leave its old companion the Body, whileſt it is uncertain whether it ſhall ſtand or fall when it comes to give an account of all it hath done in the body. But now he that is come to a certainty about his eſtate, he can not onely not be afraid of death, but alſo deſire it, and ſweetly pleaſe himſelf in the Fore-thoughts of it, yea, though it be not a natural but a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent death. Read the Book of Martyrs, and you will think that our Witneſſes to the Truth did even complement with their Torments, and lie down in the devouring flames as merrily as if they had been beds of Down. Or read the Scriptures, and you will find St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 6, 7, 8. exulting in the thoughts of his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing violent diſſolution; <hi>I am now ready to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and the time of my departure is at hand: I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſſe which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give to me, and not to me onely, but unto all that love his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</hi> At another time indeed we find him in <hi>a ſtrait, not knowing what to deſire, whether to abide in the fleſh, or to be diſſolved,</hi> Phil. 1.23.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:52563:78"/> but whence did this diſpute ariſe? not becauſe death would not be to him more deſireable and welcome and gainfull; but becauſe his abiding in the fleſh would be more profitable and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the Church. When he looked no further then himſelf, then <hi>he groaned being bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, deſiring to be cloathed upon with his houſe from Heaven; knowing that if the earthly houſe of his tabernacle were diſſolved, he had a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Onely the aſſured Chriſtian can deſpiſe the world, and joyfully endure the loſſe of his goods.</hi> He onely that knows himſelf to be cloathed with the Sun, can trample the Moon under his feet; He onely on whom God hath lift up the light of his countenance takes no care for corn and wine, hath no anxious thoughts what he ſhall eat, what he ſhall drink, or wherewithal he ſhall be cloathed. True indeed, ſuch is the vanity of all things here below, ſuch the tranſcendent excellencies of the glory of the other world, that if a man had but a poſſibility of attaining theſe, he were mad if he did not readily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thoſe; and doubtleſs, the Soul when it heareth of the Jewel of great price, doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture all to buy it, before it hath any certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that it ſhall ever actually have and enjoy it:
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:52563:79"/> I, but yet ſeeing we do naturally preferr one Bird in the hand before twenty in the buſh; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſublunary things have the advantage, though not of ſplendor and magnitude, yet of natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and nearneſs of operation; we ſhould be in great danger to take up our portion in this world, did not <hi>Faith give ſubſtance to the things hoped for,</hi> and <hi>evidence to the things not ſeen,</hi> did not alſo the Spirit ſeal up unto us our intereſt in, and title to the things hoped for and unſeen. Thoſe who have Faith, and know not themſelves to have it, do make a ſhift to crucifie the fleſh with its luſts, and to overcome the world; but it is ſomewhat an hard ſhift; much ado they have to keep themſelves from envying the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the wicked; ready they are ever and anon to cry out, <hi>In vain have we waſhed our hands in innocence, and walked mournfully all the day long;</hi> ready to have queſtionings and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, whether they had not done as wiſely to have trucked with the World for ſuch an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs as it can afford: But Faith in its vigour, Faith ſeen and felt, eaſily keeps under all ſuch carnal arguings, and ſo ſatisfies a man in the choice that he hath made, as that he is jealous and ſuſpicious leſt the World ſhould gain too much on his heart, and in the abundance of all things <hi>rejoyceth as if he rejoyced not,</hi> and in the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:52563:79"/> loſs of all things <hi>weepeth as of he wept not;</hi> the aſſured Chriſtian after he hath bought, is <hi>as if he poſſeſſed not,</hi> 1 Cor. 7, 30. and when he hath nothing, <hi>as if he poſſeſſed all things,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. <hi>Ye had compaſsion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing in your ſelves that ye have in heaven a better and enduring ſubſtance.</hi> He doth not ſay, they know barely that there was in Heaven a better and enduring ſubſtance, but that they themſelves had in Heaven a better and more enduring ſubſtance, that that eternal inheritance was reſerved for them, and that Chriſt had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon it as <hi>their fore-runner;</hi> a word which it had been preſumption for us to uſe, if the Scripture had not uſed it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. and if our Saviour himſelf had not told his Diſciples that he went afore-hand to <hi>prepare a place for them, Joh.</hi> 14.2. But how did the <hi>Hebrews</hi> know that they had this better and enduring ſubſtance? They knew it within themſelves: that is, to find that they had a title to the more enduring ſubſtance, they needed not to look any further then themſelves. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that believeth on the Son of God, hath the witneſſe in himſelf;</hi> the witneſs of what? <hi>of eternal life which is in the Son,</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, Hath Everlaſting

Hath the Spirit made known to me ſuch things as fleſh and blood cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal, and is the belief of theſe things ſo rooted in my heart as that I do make them my portion and my treaſure, as that I do heartily purſue after them, even to the renouncing of carnal pleaſures? then ſure there is in heaven an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible reſerved for me. Every man that is Chriſts hath the Spirit in him, and this Spirit is <hi>the earneſt,</hi> thrice is he ſo called, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. the <hi>Greek</hi> word uſed in all thoſe three places, and no where elſe in all the New Teſtament, is (as all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) of an <hi>Hebrew</hi> extraction, and with the <hi>Hebrews</hi> is a word of promiſe and engagement in bargains, but yet is well tranſlated in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned places <hi>earneſt,</hi> though by the <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> conſtantly <hi>pledge,</hi> for it doth among the <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers ſo ſignifie, and the Spirit is a part of that reward which is promiſed; he that hath this Spirit may <gap reason="foreign">

               <p n="3">III. <hi>Aſſurance will marvellouſly ſtrengthen againſt the cenſures and reproaches of wicked men.</hi> For why ſhould he count it any great matter to be judged of men, who knows that God hath juſtified him? What need it diſquiet him that the World accounts him an hypocrite, who hath Gods teſtimony that he is ſincere? What need he be caſt down that ſome do brand him for a factious fellow, ſo long as he ſees himſelf by the Spirit ſealed for a ſon of peace? or others call him a <hi>Tobias</hi> and <hi>Sanballat,</hi> ſo long as he is aſſured that he oppoſeth none but ſuch as are building <hi>Babel</hi> and not <hi>Sion?</hi> 'Tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Conſcience gives but a dark teſtimony, that we are ſo diſquieted with the railings of thoſe whoſe tongues are ſet on fire from Hell. Were we but once ſure that we are not the men we are repreſented to be, we might then glory in our reproaches, and eſteem them great riches, knowing that they ſhall work together for good, and that they are the badges of our Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and that there is a time coming when our righteouſneſs ſhall ſhine out as the light, and the mouth of every adverſary be ſtopped, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:52563:81"/> 1.14. <hi>If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye, for the Spirit of glory and of God reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on you.</hi> We may rejoyce in as much as we are made partakers of Chriſt's ſufferings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefrom, that when his glory ſhall be revealed, we ſhall be glad alſo with exceeding joy. <hi>If any man ſuffer as a Chriſtian, let him not be aſhamed, but let him glorifie God on this behalf, verſ.</hi> 16. He that hath the teſtimony of a good Conſcience, not onely that he <hi>is a Chriſtian,</hi> but alſo that <hi>he ſuffers as a Chriſtian,</hi> he may glory that he is accounted worthy to ſuffer reproach. But when a man hath never ſo clear teſtimony that he is a Chriſtian, if he ſhould ſuffer not as a Chriſtian, but as an <hi>evil door,</hi> or <hi>as a buſie-body in other mens matters,</hi> if he ſhould then rejoyce, he would but glory in his ſhame.</p>

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:52563:81"/> if there had been no variance betwixt us, we may then ſure <hi>come with boldneſse to the throne of grace,</hi> Heb. 4.16. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, with a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſay what we liſt, provided the matter we pray for be grounded on Divine Precept and Promiſe; provided alſo, we remember that we have to do with him who abhorreth <hi>the ſacrifice of fools,</hi> and unto whom our <hi>words</hi> ſhould be but <hi>few,</hi> full of weight and affection, void of all heartleſs tautologies and vain repetitions: Whereas when Aſſurance is wanting, a man is ready to faint, very puſillanimous, afraid to look up to God, under doubts and fears whether ever any thing will come of the requeſts he maketh whether God would not be as well pleaſed if he ſhould hold his peace as if he ſpake. There is as much difference betwixt a Chriſtian with and without Aſſurance, as betwixt a Tree in Summer and Winter, as betwixt <hi>Sampſon</hi> when his locks were on, and when they were cut off; he indeed thought when he had loſt his Hair to have done as formerly, but he ſoon found by the prevailing of the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> that he could not: ſo he that hath loſt the witneſs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, may think to rub up his graces, and pray with as much life and boldneſs as formerly he did, but he ſhall find himſelf miſtaken. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever weakneth Evidence, weakneth Prayer alſo.</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:52563:82"/> Prevailing of Luſt darkneth our Evidences, it alſo deadneth us in Praying, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.12. <hi>Innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable evils have compaſſed me about, mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities have taken hold of me ſo that I cannot look up, they are more then the hairs of my head, wherefore my heart faileth me.</hi> His heart that ſhould have furniſhed him with matter and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection failed him, nor durſt his eyes look up to the place where Gods honour did dwell. In another <hi>Pſalm</hi> he tells us his mouth was ſhut; <hi>Mine iniquity is ever before me, I am ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that I cannot ſpeak.</hi> Words which at other times he had at his command were now wanting, and he ſtood as it were a mute. O let all who complain of ſtraitneſs and deadneſs and daunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, remember what it is that muſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, embolden and enlarge them, <hi>viz.</hi> the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing, ſealing act of the Spirit; that once obtained, a Supplicant goes on as doth a Ship with full ſail where there is Sea-room enough.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>Aſſurance will ſweeten the Reading of the Word, and the Receiving of the Sacraments:</hi> For with what delight muſt he needs read over all the Promiſes of the Covenant, who hath the Spirit aſſuring him that they are all his? With what comfort muſt he needs behold the Body and Blood of Chriſt, and meditate on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52563:82"/> thence flowing, who is perſwaded that he hath an undoubted intereſt in them, and that his ſitting at the Sacramental Table is but a pledge of his ſitting with Chriſt in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his Father? and that when he eats the Bread and drinks the Wine, he doth but touch and taſte of that with the fuller meals whereof he muſt be ſatisfied to all Eternity? Yea, the Laws and Commandements which formerly ſeemed burthenſome, will, Aſſurance once gain<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed, be accounted not grievous, but eaſie and delightful; becauſe a man then feels that <hi>love</hi> in his heart <hi>which is the fulfilling of them;</hi> yea, the very threatnings and curſes of the Law, which before Aſſurance cannot but make the heart ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to quake and tremble, Aſſurance once obtained, are read and meditated on with the greateſt pleaſure, becauſe a man knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf through faith in Chriſt to be delivered from them. It is a kind of Hell on Earth, when a man goes up and down fearing leſt every place of Scripture he meets with ſhould kill him; but it is a very Heaven on Earth, when a man can look on all things contained in Scripture as his own: when he can ſay, <hi>Whether it be the world, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come, all are mine, and I am Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> To ſuch a one, if to any other, <hi>the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52563:83"/> Statutes of the Lord are right, rejoycing the heart, more to be deſired then gold, yea, then much fine gold, ſweeter alſo then the honey, and the honey-comb.</hi>

               <p n="6">VI. <hi>Aſſurance will wonderfully heighten and enlarge us in Praiſe and Thankſgivings.</hi> If the Spirit do dwell in us, yet unleſs we have the ſenſe and feeling of him, ſcarcely will our hearts be filled with joy, or our mouths with praiſe.

An aſſured Chriſtian cannot make ſuch ſweet and uninterupted melody, becauſe alas his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is not perfect, but mixed with many doubts and fears; but yet whileſt he is under the actual ſenſe and enjoyment of Gods love, he cannot but break out into his Pſalmes, Hymnes, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Songs. Hear how <hi>David</hi> rouſeth up all his faculties to joyn and bear a part in ſpiritual praiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c. Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and all that is within me bleſs his holy name: Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and forget not all his benefits; who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who healeth all thy diſeaſes, who redeemeth thy life from deſtruction, who crowneth thee with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:52563:83"/> loving kindneſs and tender mercies, who ſatisfieth thy mouth with good things, ſo that thy youth is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed like the Eagles.</hi> Nay, Aſſurance will not let a man be alone in this muſick, it will make him invite and call upon others to bear a part; if <hi>Davids</hi> cup do overflow, he calls on others to come and taſte it; <hi>O taſte and ſee that the Lord is gracious: come and I will tell you what wonderfull things he hath done for my ſoul. O praiſe the Lord for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> And again, and again, <hi>Praiſe the Lord, for his mercy endureth for ever.</hi> As good fellows, when they are well heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Wine and ſtrong drink, begin to one another in their filthy ſongs and ballads; ſo Chriſtians, <hi>being filled with the Spirit, do ſpeak to one another in Hymnes, Pſalmes, and ſpiritual Songs, ſinging and making melody to God in their hearts,</hi> Epheſ. 5.18, 19.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. <hi>Aſſurance will further Repentance in both its parts and acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For <hi>Sorrow;</hi> Nothing ſooner melts the heart then a beam from the Sun of Righteouſneſs; nothing ſooner ſends a man out with <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>weep bitterly,</hi> then a love look from Chriſt his Lord; one ſmile of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance on a ſinful ſoul not hardned, not aſleep, is enough to make it weep rivers of tears becauſe it hath tranſgreſſed his Laws. There is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:52563:84"/> ſorrow <hi>for,</hi> or in order to, the obtaining <hi>the pardon of ſin;</hi> and this is not (ſay the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian what he will to the contrary) unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a Saint; nay, it is that which he is in hundred places of Scriptures called to: but there is alſo a repenting ſorrow ariſing <hi>from pardon,</hi> a ſtriking on the thigh becauſe we have quenched the motions of ſo good a Spirit, and abuſed that riches of grace ſo clearly manifeſted. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.63. <hi>That thou maiſt remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth more, becauſe of thy ſhame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou haſt done.</hi> This may ſeem an harſh paradox, and phantaſtick dream to ſome, but they are ſuch as are not partakers of the divine nature, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous, and afflicted with nothing more then the remembrance of unkindneſs and unthankfulneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It alſo <hi>furthers us in the forſaking and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of ſin.</hi> They that are tied with this cord of love will not eaſily break it: 'tis made you know the great aggravation of <hi>Solomons</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, <hi>That he turned from the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that had appeared to him twice,</hi> 1 King. 119. That manifeſtly implyeth, that the manifeſtation of Gods love is not a ſpur to licentiouſneſs, but a bridle to keep from it. Indeed they who know their garments to be made white in the blood of the Lamb, will not eaſily ſuffer them to be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52563:84"/> again defiled with the pollutions that are in the world through luſt: corrupt nature will be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king occaſion, as from the Law, ſo from the Goſpel alſo to ſin, it will be ſuggeſting <hi>ſin that grace may abound;</hi> but renewed nature will be throwing back ſuch ſuggeſtions with abhortence, Rom. 6.1, 2. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? ſhall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin that grace may abound? God forbid: how ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein?</hi> How can we that know that our old man is crucified together with Chriſt that the body of ſin may be deſtroyed, ſerve ſin any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? how ſhall we that be married to him who is raiſed from the dead, bring forth fruit to our former dead husband? We do love our ſins na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, as we love either right eye, or right hand; Will any thing but the ſenſe of a greater love, make us to cut them off, or to pull them out? Nothing more conſtrains to the hatred of ſin, then the love of Chriſt; nothing makes us more to love him, then a ſenſe that he loveth us, and that with an everlaſting love.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Aſſurance doth marvellouſly deaden the heart to all needleſs diſputes and controverſies, and ſettle the heart in the truth, and fortifie it againſt the ſubtilties of ſeducing ſpirits.</hi> They that can <hi>read the law written on their hearts, do not dote on queſtions and ſtrife of words, but avoid profane

Had men but felt the power of thoſe truths on their hearts which are commonly diſcourſed and preached, they would not ſo eaſily have changed their minds about them as ſome in the late times were obſerved to do; had but their hearts been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with grace they could not ſo eaſily have been carried about with divers ſtrange doctrines; there's no ſuch preſervative againſt Apoſtacy and Hereſie, as Aſſurance. <hi>No man that hath drank old wine, will preſently deſire new, for he will ſay that the old is better.</hi> He that hath but heard of old Wine, and taken his opinion of its vertue upon truſt from the reports of others, may be induced to drink new Wine; but ſo will not he who hath taſted of it, and felt it making glad his heart, and ſtrengthning him againſt his many infirmities. Let the Sophiſter firſt go and perſwade the weary Traveller, that the appetites of hunger and thirſt are but fancies, or to throw away the bread and water appointed by God
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52563:85"/> for the ſatisfying of thoſe natural appetites; then may he hope to perſwade the experienced Chriſtian, that all his deſires after Chriſt are but the workings of a melancholy phanſie, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Body and Blood of Chriſt, the onely things that ever he found to ſatisfie thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> What then, can the Aſſured Chriſtian anſwer every queſtion that a ſubtil diputant makes? can he ſolve every fallacious argument of a cunning Sophiſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No: perhaps he cannot anſwer any one of his fallacies; but he hath ſuch a ſenſe of the reality and preciouſneſs of the things againſt which the fallacies are framed, that he knows them to be but fallacies, and cares not much, were it not for others ſake, whether they be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver anſwered or no. If a condemned Malefactor, dead in Law, ſhould have his Princes pardon brought him, and had accepted it, and upon acceptation of it found himſelf reſtored to life again, and every thing that made his life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable unto him, how little would he matter it whether he were pardoned by an immanent or tranſient action, or whether he did receive his pardon by an act of the underſtanding, or of the will, by one act, or by many, or whether the acceptation of his pardon were the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52563:86"/> or the condition of his pardon? As little will he who hath a ſenſe of his faith, and of his juſtification by faith, matter it how thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies are decided, that have of late years oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied the pens and tongues of ſo many both learned and unlearned: As little doth he matter it, I ſay, as to himſelf, though for the ſake of others he rejoyceth to ſee truth accurately hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and reſcued from thoſe abſurdities where-with adverſaries, taking advantage from the leſs cautious expreſſions of her friends, had loaded her.</p>
               <p>What ſayeſt thou now, O Chriſtian? is this Aſſurance worth thy ſeeking after, and praying for, or is it not? Wilt thou give all diligence to make thy calling and election ſure, or wilt thou ſtill put all to the adventure, and leave thy eternal condition at uncertainties? Methinks, after ſo many glorious effects of Aſſurance have been opened, every one that nameth the name of Chriſt ſhould be reſtleſs till he have it, and ſhould go from ordinance to ordinance till he could ſay, <hi>I am my beloveds, and my beloved is mine:</hi> Till he can ſee his name written in the Lambs book of life: till he find the white ſtone in his hand: till he taſte the hidden Manna with his mouth, and find the Spirit witneſſing to his ſpirit that he may be of good cheer becauſe that his ſins are
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52563:86"/> pardoned. I would take it for granted that ſo it ſhall be, were it not that the fleſh will alway be drawing back from, and framing objections againſt every thing that requireth diligence, and cometh not till after many Prayers and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. Endleſs it would be to attempt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all the cavils of ſlothfull perſons againſt the work I have been preſſing; two it may not be amiſs to take notice of.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Before I direct to means, it will be needfull that I premiſe ſome things.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That <hi>I do ſuppoſe true ſolid Aſſurance to be intended in the Queſtion.</hi> As for Preſumption, 1. It is needleſs to preſcribe any means for the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52563:88"/> getting of it; 'tis like ſome ill weeds, which in ſome ſoils will grow, do the Husbandman what he will or can; Satan will both plant and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and alſo give increaſe unto it; and ſo deep roots it taketh, that the very approaches of Death cannot pull it up. Nothing more uſual then for men that live under the Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel, to drop out of a golden dream, out of a fools paradiſe, into Hell. 2. If it were in the leaſt needfull to give any Directions for the attaining of this preſumptuous perſwaſion, I durſt not give them; for it is the work of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſters to throw down to the ground all thoſe buildings that are built with untempered mortar, and to pull thoſe pillows from under mens heads on which they do ſleep ſo ſecurely; we ſhould by all good means labour to vanquiſh Deſpair, but that is an enemy that doth but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome meet us in the field, it hath ſlain at moſt but its thouſands; the greateſt example of it, <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> hath not left ſome Divines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope that he is among the Sheep, and not the Goats: As for Preſumption, it hath killed its ten thouſands; it is the epidemical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and ſtrengthens it ſelf by almoſt every thing that we can ſay for the comforting of the truly tender conſcience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>for the attaining of Aſſurance there
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:52563:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> is no need that any new Rules ſhould be preſcribed,</hi> but onely that the old ſhould be put in practice: it is a ſinfull curioſity in people to look after, and in Miniſters to adviſe to onely or chiefly that which no man ever thought of but themſelves; or to account a Promiſe the leſs ſavoury, becauſe another hath ſmelled to it before them. In a matter that almoſt all practical Divines have handled, I ſhould ſuſpect what is new and had not heard <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and account that beſt which every one hath hit on: And it hath been ſome trouble to me to obſerve, 1. how ſome have made it the whole drift of their Sermons, onely to lift up Saints above their diſcouragements, as if the generality of the very beſt Congregations did not more ſtand in need of a Purge then of a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial; 2. how the very ſame men, through a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to deliver ſomething ſingular, have moſt ſtrangely tortured Scriptures, and built their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon ſuch looſe and illogical Coherences, ſuch uncouth Tranſlations of the Original, as could not ſettle any but ſuch whoſe trouble was ſeated onely in their fancy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>When all Directions are given and uſed, yet Aſſurance will not be had ordinarily, but by reflecting on the drift and courſe of our affections and actions.</hi> He therefore that will not make a ſet and ſolemn buſineſs of it to examine his own
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:52563:89"/> ſtate, muſt needs remain in uncertainty, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe then uncertainty. It muſt therefore be ſuppoſed, that all other Rules are given one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fit and prepare the Soul for Examination: I ſay to fit and prepare for Examination; for though Examination be a duty to all, yet is it not proper or ſeaſonable for all times: 'Tis no wiſdom to behold a mans face in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor booteth it to look for the ſincerity of a ſmall grace, amid many, and thoſe frequently prevailing corruptions, any more then to look for a Needle in a Bottle of Hay. We are then ripe for examination, when we have well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed our ſelves about the terms of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and know what makes a Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, and when the hurry and violence of temptation is pretty well over, and when by frequent acts we have had ſome experience of our ſelves. Theſe things premiſed, I ſay, let him who would gain Aſſurance,</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Labour to bring himſelf to be content with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Aſſurance till God ſee him meet for it.</hi> By Contentedneſs I do not mean that he ſhould ſit down ſatisfied without it, or remit his care, or neglect the means appointed for the getting of it; for 'tis not poſſible that he who doth truly prize and value Heavens joy ſhould be at reſt till his hopes of getting it are above his fears of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:52563:89"/> it; But when I ſay he ſhould be contented, I mean he ſhould not grow impatient, not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur and repine againſt God, as if he did him wrong becauſe he lets him be in the dark, or as if he were unrighteous in hiding his face from him, and ſeeming to ſhut out his prayers. There's ſcarce a more dangerous diſtemper then an haſty, over-eager, impatient deſire of comfort, for it uſually leads out of the good old way into the by-paths of errour. As thoſe who are impatient in a Fever, will needs ſuppoſe that their diſeaſe is rather in their Beds then in their Bodies, and therefore will often ſhift their beds; by which means though they find ſome preſent refreſhment, yet they do indeed increaſe the Calenture: So doth he who is impatient under his want of comfort, go from one Miniſter to another, and at laſt ſayes, Why ſhould I wait any longer? My want of comfort is not from me, but from the way and Religion in the which I have been brought up. Many an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man hath turned <hi>Papiſt, Quaker, Antinomian, Separatist,</hi> becauſe theſe ſhew unto their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes a more eaſie and ſpeedy way to comfort, then can be got on the Principles of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion, which affords no comfort to thoſe who are not <hi>Chriſtians</hi> as well as <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> May we alway hold faſt theſe Principles, leſt
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:52563:90"/> God complain, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 6.13, 14. <hi>From the leaſt to the greateſt every one is given to covetouſneſſe, and from the Prophet even unto the People, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one dealeth falſly; they have healed alſo the hurt of the daughter of my people ſleightly, ſaying, Peace, peace, where there is no peace.</hi> 
                  <q>Some one perhaps that hath read in Popiſh Authors, That without not onely Attrition but alſo Contrition there is no remiſſion, may think that I do wrong them, whileſt I number them with thoſe who do ſleightly heal trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Conſciences, eſpecially ſeeing they do require ſuch a degree and meaſure of Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as is either intenſively or appreciatively the greateſt; and they account it not ſo much as appreciatively the greateſt, till the Will doth more eſteem the deteſtation of ſin, then the attainment of any good, or eſcaping of any evil. But this notwithſtanding, they have an Art by which they can eaſily content their Diſciples, and skin over their wounds; for this they deliver as a Tenent to be at any hand maintained, That Chriſt by inſtituting the power of the Keys did conſult mans infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, appointing a way in the which he may have Divine favour without Contrition (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which it is hard to come) by meer Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he do but receive the Prieſtly Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:52563:90"/> that obtained, carnal ſorrow, becomes to all intents and purpoſes as effectual as the godly ſorrow working repentance not to be repented of. This is <hi>Receptiſsimum aliorum omnium axioma</hi> (not <hi>dogma</hi>) <hi>quod Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſuppleat ex opere operato defectum contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Gregorius de Valentia, diſput.</hi> 7. <hi>queſt.</hi> 8. <hi>de Contrit. punct.</hi> 3. Can any one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire an eaſier Religion? It is but, when a man feels ſome ſorrow ariſing from a ſlaviſh fear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking himſelf to a Prieſt, and from him recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Abſolution, and then all old ſcores are cut.</q> Let me alſo add, That it becomes us under troubles more to deſire grace then comfort; yea, not to deſire comfort upon any account ſo much as this, that <hi>the joy of the Lord may be our ſtrength;</hi> that being refreſhed with the oyl of gladneſs, we may the more eaſily and ſwiftly run the wayes of Gods Commandments. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual comfort is deſired carnally, if not deſired in order to ſervice: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.12, 13. <hi>Reſtore unto me the joy of thy ſalvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit; then will I teach tranſgreſſors thy ways, and ſinners ſhall be converted unto thee.</hi> By his <hi>free Spirit,</hi> the Pſalmiſt here means his Spirit to ſet him <hi>free from the ſlaviſh fear, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God or Man;</hi> which uſually makes us weary of our lives, and yet horribly afraid to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52563:91"/> die: But wherefore doth he deſire this free Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? not that he might be free from Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but that he might be free to his ſervice; that being not in bondage through fear, he might win others to the faith, that he might be able to encourage others to walk before God in holineſs and righteouſneſs all their days: he that uſeth not his comforts to this end, doth but turn the grace of God into wantonneſs</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A good way to gain Aſſurance, is to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for what we enjoy already.</hi> When <hi>Nathaneel</hi> was induced to believe meetly becauſe he was told of his being under the tree, Chriſt was ſo pleaſed, that he promiſed him, <hi>he ſhould ſee grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things then that,</hi> Joh. 1.50. So when we are thankful for the firſt dawnings of light, God is ſo well pleaſed with that thankfulneſs, that he cauſeth our light to grow clearer and clearer to the noon day, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.6, 7. <hi>Be careful for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: but in every thing by prayer and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with thanksgiving, let your requeſts be made known unto God, and the peace of God which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all underſtanding, ſhall keep your hearts and minds through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> To him that is thankful for what he hath, ſhall be given, but from him who is not thankful for what he hath, ſhall be taken away even that which he hath. How can we more provoke God, then if we
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:52563:91"/> over-look and deſpiſe all our mercies becauſe we want ſome one thing which we have a mind to, though no preſent meetneſs for it; yet ſo is God provoked by bad men, and by good men. Though <hi>Haman</hi> be by the King advanced above all the Princes, yet all avails him nothing ſo long as he ſaw <hi>Mordecai</hi> the Jew ſitting at the Kings gate, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 4.13. and even the father of the faithful uttereth words not much unlike, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. God bids him not fear, <hi>for he was his ſhield, and exceeding great reward.</hi> But what doth he reply? <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. <hi>What wilt thou give me ſeeing I go childleſs, and the ſteward of my houſe is this</hi> Eliezer <hi>of</hi> Damaſcus; <hi>and behold to me thou haſt given no ſeed, and lo one born in my houſe is my heir.</hi> What wilt thou give me? As if God had nothing to reward his Servants obedience with, but Children? as if he could not be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to them then many heirs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If God ſhould hide himſelf from me in temporals, I could, that hiding notwithſtanding, be thankful for ſpirituals; But what have I to be thankful for, ſo long as I know not that God loves me with a ſpecial peculiar love?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Is it nothing that thou art out of Hell, that thou art kept from running into all exceſs of riot, that thou art kept from laying violent hands on thy ſelf? nothing that thou art born
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:52563:92"/> in <hi>Emmanuels</hi> Land, that thou heareſt of the covenant of grace ſure and well ordered in all things, that thou haſt Miniſters and Chriſtian friends to help thee to lay hold of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? nothing that the Spirit hath brought thee under convictions of ſin, and enclined thy heart to ſeek out after the Goſpel cure? Surely, if thou canſt ſee nothing to be thankful for but Aſſurance, if thou ſhouldeſt have Aſſurance it ſelf, thou wouldeſt ſcarce be thankful for that, but quarrel at it, becauſe it is not clear enough, or becauſe others have more of it then thy ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>He that wants Aſſurance muſt believe till he feel that he believes, and put forth acts of love till he find that his love is ſincere and unfeigned.</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect acts would be multiplied when we have not the comfort of reflex acts; this is a rule given by all, and ſeems to be firmly grounded on that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous place, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.10. <hi>He that walketh in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſeeth no light, let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay on his God.</hi> He that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in darkneſs, and ſeeth no light, is in as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs a condition as a child of God can be in. What is the way to bring him into the light? Even to truſt in the Name of the Lord, and to ſtay on God: That is, he muſt conſider that Chriſt died for him, and that <hi>he is able to ſave
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:52563:92"/> to the uttermoſt all that come to God through him:</hi> yea, and that he hath promiſed, if he come, not to caſt him out, and by expreſs commandment hath made it his duty to believe; and in the ſtrength of theſe conſiderations, the Spirit aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, to caſt himſelf on him, and lay hold of him ſo long till he find he hath him. Thoſe who make the being aſſured that God is ours in covenant, to be the onely, and the firſt ground of reliance on God, do by conſequence make all Preaching in vain, and bring unto us a new Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. For ſuppoſe I had to do with an Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, what ſhould I ſay to him? that he doth not believe, till he is perſwaded that God is his in covenant with him? Would not this be in effect to tell him, that he muſt die in his unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief? For how ſhould he come to know himſelf to be in Covenant? Shall I tell him, becauſe he is elect? That cannot be known to him; nor if it could be known to him, would it be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to infer his being in covenant? for the elect, till renewed by grace, are the children of wrath as well as others. My buſineſs therefore is to convince ſuch a man, that if he die in his ſins, he is undone everlaſtingly, and that his own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is ſo every way imperfect, that it cannot anſwer the demands of the Law: I muſt alſo call upon him to meditate on the free and full offers
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:52563:93"/> of life and ſalvation that are made in the Goſpel, and let him know that it is his duty to lay hold of the hope that is ſet before him, and to follow ſuch kind of meditations with his prayers till he feel his heart reſolved to adventure himſelf on this bottom. But can any one ſo do? Without grace he cannot; By grace he can. And ſo did <hi>Job,</hi> Job 13.15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> I, but <hi>Job,</hi> thing deſtitute at preſent of the ſenſe of Gods favour, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his former loving kindneſſes, and with ſuch remembrances ſupport himſelf. 'Tis poſſible he might: but the ſoul that never had any ſenſe of Gods love, may come to this pitch of reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nay, to this pitch of reſolution it muſt come. For what elſe ſhould it do? To continue in a natural condition brings damnation inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, get out of it by his own ſtrength no man can. Tell him what promiſes God hath made of pardon, hee'l reply, that whatever is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed as to pardon, is ſuſpended on a condition, which condition he finds not. But then tell him, there are abſolute promiſes wherein God promiſeth to beſtow grace on the graceleſs, here his hope begins to ſtir and revive. The Lord hath promiſed to take away the heart of ſtone, and to give an heart of fleſh: In that promiſe he hath not put my name, but neither hath he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:52563:93"/> or put me out; he may do it for me as well as for another, therefore at his feet will I lie down, and no longer be unwilling he ſhould rule in my heart by his Law and Spirit, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ever ſmile on me or no, (which yet I have reaſon to hope he will). I will have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lord or Maſter but himſelf, and in the uſe of all good means will I wait on him, and look up to him, till he write his law on my heart, and put his fear into my inward parts. And this leads me to a fourth direction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Let him that wants Aſſurance wait upon God in the uſe of all good means, duties, ordinances, till he ſhew his reconciled countenance to him.</hi> I ſay all means, duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not onely becauſe the neglect of one may provoke God to reject our attendances on him in the other, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis uncertain in which God will manifeſt himſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes in <hi>Prayer</hi> he drops the oyl of gladneſs into the wounded ſpirit, and indeed in this duty as much as in any. Upon the Prayers of the Church <hi>Peters</hi> bonds were looſed; and could the Church be brought to as inſtant ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer for her doubting members that are faſt held under the chains of their troubleſome thoughts, we might find them ſooner delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But as publick prayers have this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52563:94"/> that by them God is moſt honoured, ſo private cloſet prayers have this advantage, that by and in them a man hath fairer opportunities to ſpread all his doubts before God in all their particular circumſtances. Look on <hi>David,</hi> you would think he were not the ſame man at the beginning and end of ſome of his Pſalms. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Prayer, as full of fears as the night is of darkneſs; after Prayer, as full of confidence and comfort as the Sun is of light. If our doubts do not prevail ſo far as to make us leave off praying, our Prayers will prevail ſo far as to make us to leave off doubting, Of <hi>Hannah</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>That after ſhe had prayed her countenance was no more ſad,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.18. Had we more praying, we ſhould neither have ſo many jovial ſinners, nor ſo many dejected ſaints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes <hi>in the reading or hearing of the word of God,</hi> a beam of light is let in that ſcatters all doubts and fears. The Spirit takes off the veil that is upon the Word, and the veil that is on the heart, and then a man can miſinterpret the Scripture no longer, his title to the Promiſe is no longer obſcure. The Word, it is Gods Power to Salvation; 'tis the inſtrument he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth uſe of for the begetting, ſtrengthning, confirming of faith; it anſwers all the objections that carnal reaſon can raiſe againſt either the
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:52563:94"/> fulneſs or freeneſs of Divine Grace. Therefore when people have been the very next door to deſpair, by looking into this record of Gods love, they have met with that which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered their hope, and made them to ſay, <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, pardoning iniquity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion and ſin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Sometimes <hi>God appeareth in holy religious conference. As Iron ſharpneth Iron, ſo doth a man ſharpen the face of his friend,</hi> Prov. 27.17. And therefore Chriſtians, when they meet together, ſhould encourage and ſtrengthen one another in the ſervice and worſhip of God, <hi>Exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daily, while it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin,</hi> Heb. 3. 13. Indeed, why is one comforted, but that he ſhould comfort others with the ſame conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations wherewith he hath been comforted? <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> And that no man may deſpiſe any ſerious Chriſtian, though of the meaneſt parts, let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that God maketh uſe of the diſcourſe of the fooliſh, for the converſion and confirmation of thoſe that have been in great repute for learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus the famous <hi>Junius</hi> was brought to be ſerious, by hearing the hearty diſcourſe of a Country-fellow concerning Faith, and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and our own renowned <hi>Bradford</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52563:95"/> by the diſcourſe of an unlearned Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Thus will God have it to be, that no fleſh may glory in his preſence, and that no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the body may ſay to another, I have no need of thee.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In <hi>the receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper</hi> ſometimes the Lord doth ſeal men up to the day of Redemption. I have heard ſome ſay, that they did never receive of this Banquet, but they found ſome ſenſible reviving by it; but they were ſuch as made more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of preparing themſelves then moſt now a days do. Indeed the two main ends of this Ordinance ſeem to be, Growth of Grace, and Evidence of Grace: Here the new-born babe takes in that which makes him grow up to his juſt and full proportion; here alſo the ſoul in a ſwoon takes in that Wine which makes it recover, and feel its own life and ſtrength. No man can open his mouth ſo wide, but there is that in this Ordinance which will fill it; for in it the whole Covenant is ſealed, Chriſt and all his benefits made over to the worthy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> None muſt come to this Ordinance but he who hath Aſſurance, and therefore I do ill to preſcribe it as a means to beget Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:52563:95"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a miſtake; men may without ſin come to the Lords Table, and yet have no Aſſurance that they are in favour with God. All muſt examine themſelves, and if it be clear that they are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, they muſt not in that condition venture upon the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred myſteries: but if a man do upon exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation find that in him which doth uſually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company true grace, though he be not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome fears and doubts, he may, he muſt receive; and the Sacramental Wine is the more proper for him, becauſe of thoſe infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Singing of Pſalms alſo hath been much bleſſed by God to the quieting of mens minds, and filling them with the ſenſe of his love.</hi> The Scholars of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> ſeem to have thought that ſinging had ſome natural tendency to pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cure quiet reſt, and freedome from ill affrighting dreams; hence they uſed it every night. And it is by the ancient Fathers much commended, as very powerfull for the quieting of all paſſions, and eaſing of the mind of all its perturbations. Many have I read of, that in ſinging of Pſalms have been ſweetly affected with the higheſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations: ſo that it may well be wondred how this duty came in the late times to be ſo much difuſed in the Families of perſons profeſſing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52563:96"/> Religion; Reaſons indeed have been brought againſt it by ſome, but ſuch as could ſcarcely lay hold of any but thoſe who had a mind to be deceived. But what Lie would not they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, unto whom God had ſent ſtrong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as a puniſhment of their wantonneſs, and proud contempt of thoſe Guides at whoſe mouths they were to enquire the Law? But it is hoped the folly of ſuch men is ſo manifeſted, that it will proceed no further. Sure I am, ſinging of <hi>Pſalms</hi> is a duty, when rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that makes glad the heart of God and man; by it we <hi>make melody to God;</hi> the Prayer of the upright is his delight, but the Praiſe of the upright much more: the time is coming when Prayer ſhall be no more, but Praiſes ſhall never ceaſe; 'tis an heavenly work, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no wonder if it give thoſe who do uſe it ſuch a taſte of Heavens glory, as maketh them forget all their ſorrows. That <hi>Luther</hi> could quell all his fears by ſinging the 46 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all mens mouths; but we have a more ſure and early example in holy Writ, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.13, 14. <hi>When they lift up their voice with the trumpet, and cymbals, and inſtruments of muſick, and praiſed the Lord, ſaying, For he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever; that then the houſe was filled with a cloud, even the houſe of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52563:96"/> Lord: ſo that the Prieſts could not ſtand to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter by reaſon of the cloud, for the glory of God had filled the houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Direct. 5. <hi>Let him that wants Aſſurance caſt out every ſin, ſet upon an univerſal courſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation;</hi> for God will not give his Cordials to one that hath a foul Stomack. Thoſe that dally and tamper with ſin he will have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden Manna; and I will give him a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new name written.</hi> Theſe are all metaphorical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which being put together do amount to as much as Aſſurance; but they are all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to him that overcometh, to him that rides on conquering and to conquer, vanquiſhing temptations, ſtedfaſt in the Faith. Let looſe and wanton Profeſſors talk as they pleaſe of their high enjoyments, and boaſt as they liſt of their raptures and extaſies, we do know that they lie againſt the truth. <hi>If we ſay that we have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſſe, we lie, and do not the truth,</hi> 1 Job. 1.6. But, <hi>If we have his commandements and keep them, then do we love Chriſt; if we love him, we ſhall be loved of the Father, and he will love us, and manifeſt himſelf to us,</hi> Joh. 14.21.</p>
               <p>More eſpecially, Aſſurance goes along with
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52563:97"/> ſuch acts of Obedience as do notably croſs ſome carnal intereſt; as</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Acts of Charity;</hi> a coſtly duty, but very comfortable. God makes known his mercy to thoſe who are mercifull to others. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>If thou deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring the poor that are caſt out to thy houſe; when thou ſeeſt the naked, thou cover him, and hide not thy ſelf from thine own fleſh: Then ſhall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy health ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedily: and thy righteouſneſſe ſhall go before thee, and the glory of the Lord ſhall be thy rereward: Then ſhalt thou call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer; thou ſhalt cry, and he ſhall ſay, Here I am. If thou draw out thy ſoul to the hungry, and ſatisfie the afflicted ſoul, then ſhall thy light riſe in obſcurity, and thy darkneſſe be as the noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and the Lord ſhall guide thee continually, and ſatisfie thy ſoul in drought.</hi> The <hi>Hebrews</hi> were very charitable Chriſtians, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. we read of their <hi>labour of love;</hi> they took as much pains in relieving the poor, as if they had been all Deacons; and the Saints were the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial object of their charity, and to them they were charitable for the Lords ſake. Now this <hi>labour of love</hi> was that on which the Apoſtle did build his perſwaſion, that they would not fall under that heavy doom he had denounced
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:52563:97"/> againſt Apoſtates, <hi>I am perſwaded better things of you, things that accompany ſalvation,</hi> things that cleave to ſalvation, things from which ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation cannot be ſeparated, <hi>for God is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous to forget your labour of love.</hi> And this diligence and unweariedneſs in miniſtring to the neceſſity of the Saints, is that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Apoſtles as the way to attain to the full aſſurance of hope, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>We deſire that every one of you do ſhew the ſame diligence, to the full aſſurance of hope to the end.</hi> No won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God honours this Grace, which doth ſo highly honour Him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.12. <hi>The miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion of this ſervice not onely ſupplieth the want of the Saints, but is abundant alſo by many thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings unto God, whileſt by the experiment of this miniſtration, they glorifie God for your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed ſubjection unto the Goſpel of Chriſt, and for your liberal diſtribution unto them, and unto all Saints.</hi> Thoſe who make it their grand plot and deſign to grow rich, do pierce themſelves through with many temptations; and when they come to lie down on their ſick-beds, they have no more eaſe then if they did lie down on beds of thorns: But thoſe who have wiſely conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the poor, the Lord maketh their beds for them in their ſickneſs, needs muſt they lie down in peace, and ſleep ſweetly. <hi>It is a more bleſſed
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:52563:98"/> thing to give then to receive;</hi> and therefore we ſhould rejoyce not when we receive of the bounty of others, but when we have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, to expreſs our bounty towards thoſe who do ſerve God in a worſe condition then our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The duty of Fraternal correption</hi> may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly hazard a mans repute and eſteem in the world, and make him accounted a buſie prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical fellow, but it will endear us in the eyes and ſight of God: God will give ſome eminent token of his love to thoſe who are not aſhamed of him in the midſt of a crooked, adulterous generation; men of ſuch courage are ſeldome known long to lie under any anxious fears of their eternal ſtate.</p>

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Loving of thoſe that hate us,</hi> bleſſing thoſe that curſe us, praying for thoſe that perſecute us, are actions very contrary to corrupt nature, unto which nothing is more pleaſing then private revenge; but they have on them ſo much of the Image of him that maketh his Sun to riſe on the evil and on the good, and ſendeth his rain on the juſt and unjuſt, that they clearly evidence to him that is conſcientious in exerting them, his Adoption: He cannot long queſtion his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs from God, who finds in himſelf an heart ready to forgive all who treſpaſs againſt him;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:52563:99"/> for how ſhould not the God of all mercies much more readily forgive, then he who hath but a very dram of mercy? Let any one who is of a trembling heart, but go into his cloſet, and there pour out his ſoul in ſupplications for the pardon and ſalvation of thoſe who perſecute him, he can ſcarce not thence draw a deal of divine ſweetneſs and ſecret ſenſe of Gods love. Unto ſuch a one, ſooner then to any other, would I promiſe ſettlement in a ſure and glorious peace. But revengeful projects are ſo black and helliſh, as that they cannot conſiſt with calmneſs of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. God indeed doth not a ſecond time put any ſins into the Book of his remembrance, which he hath once blotted out: but a malicious revengefull proſecution of our fellow Chriſtians, may write over in our own hearts and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all thoſe ſins that were by the Blood of Chriſt before blotted out; for there is not as to all things the ſame reaſon of the Original of the Act of Indempnity kept in the hands of God, and the Counterpane of it kept within our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Direct. 6. <hi>Let not any that would attain Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, give way to any unneceſſary ſcruples or doubts about his condition;</hi> or think that every thing w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> calleth for trouble and ſhame, doth preſently make a man an hypocrite, or out of covenant with
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:52563:99"/> God: It is therefore wiſdom, as ſoon as any doubt ariſeth, preſently to take our ſelves to task, and ſee whether that which we have againſt our ſelves be ſuch a matter as from whence we can rationally infer that God and we are ſtill at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. I ſhall not here take occaſion to deſcend to particular doubts, for they are numberleſs; and beſides, to anſwer doubts in writing, avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth little, becauſe a doubt as repreſented to a tempted ſoul, ſcarce ſeems to be the ſame thing that it is when deſcribed on paper; yet there are ſome general Rules that may be laid down, which if particularly applied, will be of great uſe for the ſilencing of doubts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>I ought not to make my ſelf an hypocrite for that which the holy Scriptures do no where make a character of hypocriſie.</hi> If any conſolation were tendred to me, had it not a foundation in the Scriptures. I were bound to reject it, and ſo am I to put away all trouble which comes not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome Scripture. By this rule our firſt Reformers did extricate themſelves and others, out of thoſe labyrinths of deſperation into which Popery had led them; and the rule hath ſtill a ſtanding neceſſary uſe, and if obſerved, would ſet at liberty many who do account themſelves bound.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>I muſt not make my ſelf an hypocrite for
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:52563:100"/> that which would make the whole generation of the faithful Hypocrites as well as my ſelf.</hi> If I have a mind to gratifie my ſelf in hard thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my ſelf, yet I ought not to have hard thoughts of every one elſe too. If I cannot ſee my own name written in the Lambs book of life, yet I muſt not blot out the names of all that make up the body of Chriſt Jeſus. We may therefore obſerve, if we have opportunity, the confeſſions of thoſe who are, if any other, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere; and if we do find but the ſame luſtings to ſin which they alſo complain and acknowledg to be in themſelves, we may not for ſuch luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings conclude our ſelves to be out of covenant with God: or if we do think there is not ſecurity enough in this courſe, then may we read over the hiſtories of thoſe who have Gods teſtimony in Scripture that they were his children; and if we find that our ſpot is but as theirs was, we need not for it fear our condition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>I need not trouble my ſelf about that which hath been already objected againſt me, and fully by me anſwered.</hi> If a controverſie hath been long handled, the queſtion truly ſtated, arguments on both ſides clearly produced, which way a man hath gone he will go, and not ſuffer himſelf to be removed from his opinion by every new book, in which are onely the old arguments in
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:52563:100"/> a new dreſs, without any new additional ſtrength. Sophiſters, if you give them an ear, will be wrangling infinitely; ſo will the Devil, and our own carnal hearts: we muſt therefore do by them as Moderators do by Opponents after their argument hath been anſwered; bid them either urge it further, or uſe ſome new argument, or elſe be ſilent; elſe ſhall we both loſe our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious time, and alſo wrangle away our conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And let all thoſe who might ſee the ſeal of the Spirit on their hearts, did they not nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh needleſs doubts, well conſider, that they do by diſquieting themſelves with childiſh irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fears, commit a very great ſin. For 1. <hi>They do rob the Spirit of all the honour due unto him for the work that he hath wrought in their hearts.</hi> And can it chooſe but grieve him, when he hath put forth power equivalent to that by which the world was created, by which Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, to find it overlooked and not at all acknowledged? 2. <hi>He ſins againſt his ſoul in hindring the growth it might make were it not hindred by continual fears that the root is ſtill unſound.</hi> Poſſeſs a builder with an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that his foundation is not ſure laid, and you will never perſwade him to carry on his fabrick with any vigour; for he will ſtill be thinking that when the ſtorms and tempeſts ariſe it will
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:52563:101"/> fall, and the higher he hath raiſed it, the more ſhameful will be its fall. 3. By thus diſavowing Gods work of grace, <hi>he doth diſhearten and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his fellow Chriſtians,</hi> who obſerving him (of whom they alway had far better thoughts then of themſelves) to doubt of his ſincerity, do begin to queſtion their own. 4. By nullify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in conceit the new creature on ſuch weak grounds, <hi>he extreamly hardens the unconverted;</hi> who will hence be ready to conclude, that no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion lies deeper then the phanſie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But if out of a fear not to deny a true evidence, I ſhould truſt to a falſe evidence, I were then eternally undone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> True. And therefore I am not now perſwading any man to ſlight any doubt bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed either on Scripture or reaſon, but onely ſuch as have all their force meerly from a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſapprehenſion of God, or of his covenant. Let a man fear where fear is; but let him not make that matter of fear, which is indeed ground of confidence: let him not ſay, that God loves him not becauſe he chaſteneth him, when as he ſcarcely could be thought to love him if he did not chaſten him; neither let him for every flaw or crack call himſelf reprobate ſilver, nor yet make every blaſphemous thought an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable ſin, which perhaps is ſo far from being
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:52563:101"/> an unpardonable ſin, that it is meerly his miſery, and not at all his ſin; for if the blaſphemy ariſe not out of my heart, but be injected by Satan, I not conſenting to it, 'tis my trouble, but his ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But I have been told, that there is undiſcerned as well as diſcerned hypocriſie; and how then can I ceaſe doubting?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Undiſcerned hypocriſie, is onely in thoſe who have no mind to diſcern; he that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly proveth his own works, and heartily prayeth, <hi>Search and try me, O Lord, if there be any way of wickedneſs in me,</hi> cannot be in a way of wickedneſs in me, and not know it. God may for a ſeaſon hide from us our ſincerity, but prevailing hypocriſie cannot, at leaſt ſhall not be hidden from us, if we ſearch carefully to find it out.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 6. part. 2. <hi>How may he who hath Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance do to preſerve and keep it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a right uſeful and weighty que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: for <hi>[Non minor eſt virtus, quam quaerere parta tueri]</hi> no leſs care and prudence is required to keep up Aſſurance, then to gain it. Little, as we are taught in Metaphyſicks, is the difference betwixt <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Duration, Creation</hi> and <hi>Conſervation.</hi> The Spirit, who is the author of Aſſurance, is alſo the carrier of it on; and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52563:102"/> thoſe Duties and Ordinances which are the wombs in the which it is conceived, are alſo the breaſts that do ſuckle and nouriſh it. Adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it hath been thought by ſome, to have ſome one promiſe unto which we may have recourſe when troubles threaten; and <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> it is moſt adviſeable when ſtorms return, to flie to that promiſe which we did lay hold of and eſcape ſhipwrack by when they did firſt ariſe. Much of what was ſaid in anſwer to the firſt part of the queſtion, will alſo ſerve to anſwer this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of it, yet I will ſpeak ſomewhat to it diſtinctly. He therefore that would hold faſt his Aſſurance, let him</p>
               <p n="1">I. Labour <hi>to imprint on his heart, a true and firm knowledg of the covenant of grace. He that underſtands this, may</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luther) give thanks to God, and account himſelf a good Divine.</hi> He that underſtands it not, is neither good Divine. nor Chriſtian: For therefore do our conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions not fail, becauſe this covenant is ſure, and well ordered in all things. Two things eſpecially there be in this Covenant, in which it concerns all, who would not be as the waves of the Sea driven with every wind, to be well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Upon what terms we take God:</hi> And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we take him to ſanctifie and pardon and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:52563:102"/> us, not to make us rich and wealthy in the world. Nay, if we underſtand our ſelves, we leave it to him, if he will but make us partakers of the Divine Nature, to deſpoil us, when it may tend to his glory and our own good, to the utmoſt nakedneſs. To liſt our ſelves among Chriſts Diſciples, is to profeſs that we have it in a readineſs to forſake Father and Mother, Brethren and Siſters, and whatever elſe is dear unto us. A believing meditation of this, will quench that fiery dart with which many a godly man hath been pierced, even to the utter loſs of all his Aſſurance of Salvation: For what more uſual then for perſons to conclude God hath forſaken them, becauſe he hath ſomewhat leſſened the ſtream of Temporal Mercies. Let an Angel from Heaven tell <hi>Gideon the Lord is with him,</hi> he'l not believe, as long as his people are in the hands of the <hi>Midianites; If the Lord be with us, why then is all this befallen us?</hi> Judg. 6.13. <hi>Naomi</hi> returned home laden with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grace, yet ſhe ſaith to her neighbours, <hi>Call me not</hi> Naomi, <hi>but call me</hi> Mara, <hi>for the Lord hath dealt very bitterly with me: I went out full, but the Lord hath brought me home again empty, Ruth</hi> 1.20. Upon ſuch an account alſo <hi>Job</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth, <hi>That God had hidden his face, and did hold him for his enemy,</hi> Job 13.24. Could any
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:52563:103"/> thus argue, if they had not forgot that when they did take Chriſt, they did then alſo take up his Croſs?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Upon what terms God receiveth us into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;</hi> viz. not on the terms of perfect, unſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but ſincere and hearty obedience; and with expreſs promiſe never to forſake us till we have forſaken him, which he reckons us not to have done, till we let ſome inferiour good have more of our heart then he hath. Through non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this, many one hath caſt away all his hope, meerly becauſe of ſins of forgetfulneſs, inconſideration, paſſion; he is over-taken with anger, pettiſhneſs, inordinate fear; he hath eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſome little matter more then the neceſſities of nature required; he had ſome wandring thoughts in duty; he omitted an opportunity of counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a friend: What then? therefore God is not in Covenant with him? Nay, but thence no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be inferred, ſave onely that he is not yet with God in Heaven; for whatever is of frailty omitted or committed, hath a pardon on courſe granted unto it; if any man thus ſin, <hi>he hath an Advocate with the Father,</hi> who hath procured for him that he may lay actual claim to eternal life, and make faithful plea for mercy. He therefore that would keep his Aſſurance, muſt, when ſins are brought to remembrance,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:52563:103"/> and ſet in order before him by Satan, thus ſay, Were my ſins preſumptuous ſins, enormous conſcience-waſting crimes? if ſo, then is all my actual claim to the promiſe of Eternal Life ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended till I recover my ſelf again by renewed repentance; my right and title to Heaven I may retain, but my preſent fitneſs for it is loſt; if they were not preſumptuous ſins, then may I with wonted boldneſs go to the Throne of Grace and call God Father.</p>
               <p n="2">II. He that would keep his Aſſurance <hi>muſt thankfully and admiringly acknowledge the goodneſs of God in beſtowing it on him.</hi> God doth expect a tribute of Praiſe for every Mercy; by not paying that tribute we forfeit the mercy: but if after ſo great a mercy as Aſſurance we continue to be unthankfull, we may expect, that as we forfeit our Aſſurance, ſo God will alſo take the forfeiture. Indeed what will a man be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for, who is not thankful for the ſenſe of Gods pardoning, adopting love? 'Tis not Heaven, but it is near of kin to Heaven; 'tis not <hi>the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> but it is <hi>the firſt fruits of it,</hi> &amp; we know that Gods people were commanded to bring their Oblation of Thankſgiving when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their firſt-fruits, becauſe the firſt-fruits were a pledge and pawn of the whole Harveſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. <hi>Bleſſed be God and the Father of our
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:52563:104"/> Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the reſurrection of Jeſus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance incorruptible, &amp;c.</hi> If God had onely aſſured us, that we ſhould ſpend Eternity in ſome <hi>Limbus</hi> unacquainted with pain and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (ſeeing we do know that by our ſins we have deſerved to receive our portion with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and unbelievers, where there is weeping, wailing and gnaſhing of teeth) monſtrous ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude were it not to admire ſo great love: but if God have given us a well grounded hope that our names are written in Heaven, that we have a title to that Paradiſe in compariſon with which the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> was but a dunghill, this is ſuch a mercy as is undervalued if it be thought on without aſtoniſhment; if it do not cauſe us frequently with <hi>David</hi> to ſit down before the Lord, and ſay, <hi>Who are we, and what is our houſe, that thou haſt brought us hitherto? And this was yet a ſmall thing in thy ſight, O Lord God, but thou haſt alſo ſpoken of thy ſervants for a great while to come; and is this the manner of men, O Lord God? O how great is thy goodneſs which thou haſt laid up for thoſe that fear thee?</hi> 2 Sam. 7. Pſal. 31.19. But if any one who hath the love of God ſhed abroad in his heart, do in a ſhort time grow ſo ſtupid as not to allow himſelf time ſufficient to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:52563:104"/> view the height, depth, breadth, and length of that love, let him not wonder if he be brought back to the valley of the ſhadow of death and darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>He that would keep his Aſſurance muſt keep himſelf from returning to ſin, eſpecially from returning to that ſin upon which Conſcience in its former accuſations was wont to lay the greateſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis.</hi> Pſal. 85.8. <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak; for he will ſpeak peace unto his people, and to his ſaints: but let them not return to folly.</hi> If they do, inſtead of peace they ſhall ſoon find trouble; for the ſin which was ſo loathſome and uneaſie as that we had no reſt till we had vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it up, muſt needs be far more loathſome and uneaſie if we do return unto it after we have caſt it up. If the Devil, after he hath departed for a ſeaſon, return, he returneth not alone, but bringeth with him ſeven more ſpirits worſe, more defiling, more tormenting then the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Can a man that is regenerate loſe the Spirit of regeneration?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If he can, after grace received, ſin with full conſent, delight and contentment, he may: but ſome ſay that God is by promiſe engaged never to let him ſin at ſuch an high rate; others deny that there is any ſuch promiſe: Which way my judgment in this controverſie inclined, I
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:52563:105"/> before ſhewed; but this is agreed on by all ſober Divines, That a wilfull relipſe doth notably weaken the habit of Faith, and make our own ſpirits unable to teſtifie of our Adoption, and ſo grieve the Spirit of God as that he will not teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and give the evil ſpirit advantage to ſuggeſt that we are utter reprobates, and in no capacity of being renewed by repentance.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>He that would keep his Aſſurance, muſt be carefull to keep the vows that he did make to God in the time of his trouble.</hi> It ſeems natural to thoſe that are in perplexity, to make unto God promiſes of ſuch things as they ſuppoſe will be acceptable to him. We find in Scripture this to have been the practice of bad and good. But the Devil finding that at ſuch times we have more affection then judgment, puts us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to vow things in their own nature unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; ſuch vows oblige not to performance, but onely to repentance: No other is the obligation of vows made of things indeed not unlawfull in themſelves, but yet impoſſible to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out neglecting the duties of our places and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is not unlawfull to ſet apart one day in the week, beſides the firſt, to the direct immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate acts of Religion; but if my body will not bear it, or if the neceſſities of my family will not conſiſt with it, or if I am under Authority,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:52563:105"/> and Governours will not permit it, then the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating of ſo much time for Religion becomes to me unlawful, nor can any vow oblige me to it. But the vows we have made of things in our power, and pleaſing to the Almighty, muſt be performed, elſe they will be upon us, and break our peace ſo as nothing more. <hi>When thou voweſt a vow unto God, defer not to pay it, for he hath no pleaſure in fools. Pay that which thou haſt vowed. Better it is that thou ſhould not vow, then that thou ſhouldeſt vow and not pay. Suffer not thy mouth to cauſe thy fleſh to ſin, neither ſay thou before the Angel, it was an error; wherefore ſhould God be angry at thy voyce, and deſtroy the work of thy hands?</hi> Eccleſ. 5.4, 5, 6. Do not ſo much as deferr to pay, for God hath no pleaſure in fools. It is certainly a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and the meaning can be no other, than that he is greatly diſpleaſed with thoſe who go about one while to flatter him in making a vow, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to mock him in refuſing or delaying to perform it. <hi>Say not before the Angel it was an error;</hi> Do not ſay it was imprudently made, that it was an ignorance which thou art willing to expiate. <hi>Wherefore ſhould God be angry?</hi> Wherefore ſhould he foam? A dreadful place of Scripture, often to be thought on by thoſe who alter vows make enquiry. Deliberation
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:52563:106"/> is needful before the vow be made, and we ſin if we vow raſhly: but it is one thing to ſin in vowing, another thing to vow to ſin; if we have ſinned in vowing, yet if the matter of the vow was not ſomething ſinful, we muſt not alter; or if we will alter, we muſt not expect to dwell in the Lords holy hill.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>He that would continue his Aſſurance, muſt bring forth ſuch fruit after Aſſurance as he either did not, or could not, before Aſſurance.</hi> For the Rule holds here, <hi>Whoſoever hath, to him ſhall be given, and he ſhall have more abundance: but whoſoever hath not, from him ſhall be taken away even that he hath,</hi> Mat. 13.12. God will not long let his candle ſhine on him who doth no more then what he might have done, had he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in darkneſs. But if when God hath lift up upon us the light of his countenance, we then walk as children of the light, our light ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; we ſhall not onely be quiet, but alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and make our boaſt of him; we ſhall grow from a probable, to a certain and infallible hope of Heaven. God doth never from thoſe who are in covenant with him withhold thoſe influences that are <hi>ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary</hi> for the avoiding of ſin, or performance of a duty; when it is a duty (affirmative precepts do not oblige <hi>ad ſemper</hi>) but there are aids or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:52563:106"/> called by ſome <hi>arbitrary,</hi> by others <hi>liberal,</hi> by which a man is enabled with leſs difficulty to abſtain from evil, and to lead an holy life; theſe aids are uſually vouchſafed to the aſſured Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: If theſe notwithſtanding he yield to temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or omit duties, or perform them either ſleightly or unchearfully, ay, or if he do not encourage others to wait on God, it may well be expected that God ſhould withdraw them, and give Sin and Satan ſome notable advantage againſt him. Thoſe very omiſſions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions which would not provoke God to deny Aſſurance at firſt, may provoke him to recal it after it is granted.</p>
               <p>Queſt. 6. part 3. <hi>How may Aſſurance when it is loſt be regained?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This queſtion ſuppoſeth that Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance may be loſt; a ſuppoſition I am ſo farr from not granting, that I humbly conceive it may be loſt, and a man not ſenſible of it. That it may be loſt in part, and a man take no great notice of the loſs, will be eaſily granted; and why not in whole? Is it not poſſible that the great Duties of ſelf-reflection and examination ſhould be for ſome time diſcontinued, or not impartially performed? If ſo, how eaſily may one judge that livelineſs and enlargedneſs which ariſeth meerly from temper of body, or increaſe

Hiſtories do abound with examples, of men who meeting with perſons of great pretended zeal and piety, have been by them led into ſuch practiſes as could not ſtand with an actual aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of pardon: yet till by ſome providence the vizor hath been pulled off the face of ſuch hypocritical Guides, they have not miſſed their comforts. The conſolation of the Holy Ghoſt muſt needs be gone, onely another conſolation did grow up inſtead of it, ariſing from compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring themſelves with others of different perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from them, whom they ſaw to be worſe then themſelves, or from the teſtimony and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe given them from their companions whom they reputed alway the moſt holy; <hi>Meaſuring themſelves by themſelves, and comparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves among themſelves, they are not wiſe or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.12. May all whom Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hath got into this ſnare, by timely repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance recover themſelves; for it is of all ſnares the moſt dangerous, as being laid by the Devil transforming himſelf into an Angel of Light, and his Miniſters transformed into Miniſters of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Some there be who have loſt their Aſſurance, and are ſenſible of that loſs, and they are of two ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:52563:107"/>I. Such as have fallen into ſuch ſins as do till repented of make them unmeet for pardon, and much more unmeet for Aſſurance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such whoſe perſwaſion of pardon might have ſtill put forth it ſelf into act, had they not looked on their ſins through a falſe glaſs, and ſo unduly aggravated them. This latter ſort are not to be favoured in their hard thoughts of themſelves; they muſt have the falſeneſs of thoſe <hi>Rules,</hi> by which they miſ-judge themſelves diſcovered, and be made to know that they greatly diſhonour God, whileſt they meaſure his thoughts by their own thoughts, whileſt they look on him as extreme to mark what men do amiſs, who is indeed gracious and mercifull, ſlow to anger, pardoning iniquity, tranſgreſſion, ſin. Yet care would be taken, leſt while we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to cure men of this injudicious (and therefore falſly ſo called) humility, we caſt them not into a more dangerous diſeaſe, ſpiritual ſloth &amp; ſecurity.</p>
               <p>But it is the former ſort of troubled ſouls to whom my Directions are deſigned, (though ſomething may be ſaid that will not be unuſefull to the latter. Them I adviſe</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>To bring themſelves to a due and juſt ſenſe of their condition.</hi> I ſay, a due and juſt ſenſe; for there are in this caſe two extremes to be avoided,</p>
               <p n="1">I. A <hi>ſleighting of it.</hi> They who err on this
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:52563:108"/> hand have either benummed their conſciences; or elſe they have, through the cares of the world and multitude of buſineſs, ſo diverted their thoughts, as that conſcience hath no time to ſpeak. One would have thought that <hi>David</hi> after committing Adultery ſhould have been a <hi>Magor miſſabib,</hi> a terrour to himſelf and all round about him: but he ſeems rather to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with ſinfull contrivances how he might cover that ſin, nor do we find any complaint of <hi>broken bones,</hi> till <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet had awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened him. To ſuch I would ſay, <q>
                     <hi>Remember from whence ye are fallen.</hi> Ye are fallen from the ſmiles to the frowns of a Father, of an Husband who can arm all the creatures in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth againſt you, who can turn all ſweet things into bitterneſs. Is it nothing to you, that for ought you know your names are blotted out of the Lambs book of Life? nothing that you lie open to eternal wrath? What are your pillows made of, that you can give either ſleep to your eyes, or ſlumber to your eye-lids, and not reckon that God will break in upon you while there is none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Some have too deep ſenſe of this condition,</hi> looking on themſelves whileſt in it as deſperate, as having committed the unpardonable ſin.
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:52563:108"/> There be two places in the Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> that have ſome aſpect this way, theſe have horribly puzled ſome of the ancients, and are uſually ſet home to the full by the Devil and a miſgiving heart in this evil day. To remove this error, I will not digreſs into an inquiry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the nature and ſymptoms of the unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable ſin, about which it is moſt certain ſome have diſcourſed very wildly; it may ſuffice to ſay, that a preſumptuous ſinning after the grace of Aſſurance received, though it cauſe a ſore wound, yet not an incurable wound. <hi>There is balm in</hi> Gilead, <hi>a Phyſician in</hi> Iſrael. Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures give promiſes after ſuch lapſes, and furniſh us with examples of ſome who have recovered out of them; nay, it is thought by moſt, that ſuch falls do not leave the perſon thus fallen, dead, but onely in a ſwound; if ſo, he may ſomewhat relieve himſelf with remembring the days of the years of the right hand of the moſt High, and by means of grace ſtill left, act, being firſt acted, ſomewhat towards his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery: his ſin indeed is in ſome reſpects more hainous then any ſin of an unregenerate perſon, but yet if not quite deprived of the ſpirit of life, he may do that which a man who is void of the ſpirit cannot do. This leads me to the ſecond Direction.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:52563:109"/>II. <hi>Let him who hath loſt his comforts, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how and which way he loſt them.</hi> The cure uſually is half wrought, when the cauſe of the trouble is found out: and ſometimes it is not difficult to find out the cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> when Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance goes away <hi>ſimul</hi> and <hi>ſemel,</hi> when all of a ſudden a man is carried out of the Wine-cellar into the Dungeon, he can hardly be ignorant what it was that provoked God thus to change his actings towards him; it can hardly be that it ſhould be any thing but ſome notorious ſin lately committed by him. Such ſins are found without <hi>ſecret ſearching,</hi> Jer. 2.24. <hi>They are open before hand, and go before hand to judgment,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.24. Theſe muſt humbly be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to God, and the Church too, if they be of that nature as that the Church by them hath been ſcandalized. Let wanton proud wits ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue as they pleaſe, and cavil as they liſt, God will own that power he hath entruſted his Church with, and retain the ſins that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth. But when Conſcience hath brought in ſome ſuch ſin as the cauſe of all the unquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and trouble feared or felt, it muſt not reſt ſatisfied in acknowledgment of that ſin; a man muſt by and through it go to the other ſins of his life, and to Original ſin, the fountain of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſin. As <hi>David,</hi> when by <hi>Nathans</hi> meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:52563:109"/> he was made to poſſeſs the ſin of Murder, from which he <hi>prays to be delivered,</hi> Pſal. 51.14. doth alſo confeſs the corruption of his nature. ver. 5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> Sometimes the black cloud hath been long a gathering, then it is the more difficult to find out what the ſins are that did contribute moſt matter toward it. And therefore more care muſt be uſed in ſearching our hearts, and trying our ways, and Prayer muſt be made to God, that he would ſhew unto us, <hi>Wherefore he hath hardned our hearts from his fear, and cauſed us to err from his ways.</hi> This was <hi>Elihu's</hi> counſel to <hi>Job,</hi> Job 34.31, 32. <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid to God, I have born cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement, I will not offend any more: That which I ſee not, teach thou me; if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> This ſearching muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till we find; And when the <hi>Achan</hi> is found out, muſt we then ſit ſtill? Nay, then muſt we bewail it before God; The evil way muſt be forſaken that cauſed God to forſake us; That good way which when we left God did leave us, muſt we return unto. <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen, repent, and do thy firſt works, Revel.</hi> 2.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> Can one in this caſe do his firſt works?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not in their wonted perfection: but in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52563:110"/> ſome ſort he can, or at leaſt he can go to him who reneweth ſtrength to the weak, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth thoſe who are in trouble. To ſpend time in whining complaints, is more eaſie and more pleaſing to thoſe who have bruiſed themſelves; but to ſtir up ſtrength and be doing, is more ſafe and pleaſing to God. I would not have deſerted ſouls chidden for crying out and roaring; How can they do other, <hi>whoſe wounds ſtink, and are corrupt, whoſe ſores run all the night long?</hi> But they muſt not ſpend all their time in roaring, but get the broken bones ſet, and make uſe of them, ſo ſhall they recover ſtrength, and rejoyce.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>He that would regain his Aſſurance, muſt juſtifie God until it return.</hi> This is, if any other, in all Chriſtianity an hard duty. Satan reckons that all whom God toucheth, not onely in their bone and fleſh, but alſo in their ſpirit, will not fail to curſe him to his face. <hi>Job</hi> did not do ſo, but he came as near it as one could do, and not do it; he curſed almoſt every thing beſides God, <hi>Job</hi> 3.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, many an hard thought did riſe in his heart againſt God himſelf, and ſome hard words he uttered againſt him, as will appear to any that will read his Book: the way to prevent all, whether hard thoughts or ſpeeches, is to hold our eyes on our ſins, and well and duly to conſider their demerit: ſo ſhall
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:52563:110"/> we wonder that no worſe thing hath befallen us; that we are not under horror and deſpair total and final, and remedileſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3, 4. <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg my tranſgreſsion, and my ſin is ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. Againſt thee, thee onely have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight. That thou might<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and be clear when thou judgeſt.</hi> When we ſeriouſly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently think of ſin, and God againſt whom ſin is committed, we do ſoon clear him; and when we juſtifie him, it is not long ere he juſtifie us, in his Court of Heaven, in the Court of our own Conſciences, and in the Court of the Church too, (many of whoſe members are apt to condemn thoſe for hypocrites againſt whom God writes bitter things.) While <hi>Job</hi> thought that God wronged him, God ceaſed not to <hi>ſcare him with dreams, and terrifie him with viſions; to ſhoot arrows into him, the poyſon whereof did drink up his ſpirits. When he acknowledged, that God could do every thing, and that no thought could be with holden from him, and began to abhor himſelf in duſt and aſhes; then God takes his part againſt his uncharitable friends, turns his captivity, and gives him twice as much as he had at firſt,</hi> Job 42.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>He that would regain his loſt Aſſurance, muſt offer unto God what terms of agreement he
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:52563:111"/> pleaſeth;</hi> be glad to be received into favour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hardeſt conditions. <hi>I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy ſon; make me as one of thy hired ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> Luk. 15.18, 19. as one of thy hired ſervants, who fare hard, and work hard, and ſeldom are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the preſence of their Maſter; he was content to be any thing, ſo he might again be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into his Fathers houſe. This is the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of repentance, whether initial, or renewed; it makes a man peremptory, never more to draw in the iron yoke of ſin, but willing to take any other yoke that Chriſt ſhall think meet to lay on him; to put his mouth in the duſt, yea, to lick the duſt, if there may be any hope for him. Therefore <hi>Abſalom,</hi> when he would coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit a ſtrain of true repentance, thus expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.32. <hi>Let me ſee the Kings face, and if there be any iniquity in me, let him kill me.</hi> He choſe rather to be out of the world, then out of the Kings favour. Whether <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> favour were to be bought ſo dear or no, Gods favour is; for as his anger is worſe then death, ſo his loving kindneſs is better then life. He never duly eſtimated the light of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, who would not get one glimpſe of it, though on condition preſently after to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the chambers of darkneſs. He never truly
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:52563:111"/> prized communion with the Father and Son, who would not part with houſes full of ſilver and gold rather then not partake of it. <hi>I have born nine Children</hi> (ſaith that good woman in Mr. <hi>Bolton) with as great pain, I think, as other women; I would with all my heart bear them all over again, and paſs again every day through the ſame intolerable pangs as long as I live, to be aſſured of my part in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> A very Hypocrite in ſome tempeſt of terror might ſay as much; but when this is become the frame of heart, to will the blood of Chriſt abſolutely, it is not long uſually ere God ſprinkles us with it. Here ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may ſee whence it is that they ſpend the moſt of their days in grievings and groans, namely, becauſe they will not riſe up to the terms and conditions of comfort. <hi>Would they confeſs their tranſgreſsions unto the Lord, he would forgive the iniquity of their ſin: But if they will keep ſilence, let them not wonder if their bones wax old through roaring all the day long, if Gods hand lie heavy on them day and night, till their moiſture be turned into the drought of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> Would they ply their hearts with ſtirring thoughts, then they would revive; but if they be ſo lazy as never to commune with their hearts, no wonder that they remain benummed. Would they be humble, God would give them more
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:52563:112"/> grace; but if they ſuffer their proud thoughts to exalt themſelves againſt the knowledg of Chriſt, no wonder God ſets himſelf againſt them. The terms of the Covenant are made ſo low, that God cannot in honour ſtoop lower; if any one cannot bring himſelf to cloſe with them, let him not think that God will find out new ways to ſatisfie his longing follies and lazy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>He that would regain his loſt Aſſurance, muſt be ſure to pray hard.</hi> Profane wits make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves merry with us, becauſe commonly in all our Directions we bring in Prayer for one. They may as well laugh at Feaſt-makers, who in all their entertainments furniſh their tables with Bread and Salt; or with Phyſicians, who make Aloes an ingredient in almoſt every Pill. Some duties are more peculiarly ſuted to ſome one kind of trouble, but Prayer ſanctifies and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens all, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. <hi>Is any man afflicted, let him pray.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. If any man ſuffer evil, of what kind ſoever, he will find it uſeful to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelf to Prayer; eſpecially in ſoul-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes and deſertions Prayer muſt needs be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious, becauſe it ſeemeth to be one main end God aimeth at in withdrawing himſelf, to make his people more fervent and frequent in Prayer. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 5.15. <hi>I will go and return to my
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:52563:112"/> place, till they acknowledge their offence, and ſeek my face; in their affliction they will ſeek me early.</hi> I will return to my place, I will as it were ſhut my ſelf up in Heaven as if I regarded them not, till they ſeek my face, that is, my favour; in their affliction they will ſeek me early, betimes, with all ſpeed, with care and vigour alſo, at ſuch a rate as men are wont to do things in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hence we ſhall obſerve, That the adopted children of God have when under deſertion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their prayers. <hi>David</hi> did ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30.6, 7, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.1, 2. So did <hi>Heman,</hi> Pſal. 88.1, 2, 9. yea, of the natural Son it is ſaid, <hi>That being in an agony he prayed more earneſtly,</hi> Luk. 22.44. that agony made him more to expreſs his earneſtneſs, then at other times: And when all other means have been uſed without ſucceſs, Prayer hath preſently effected the cure, ſo that man in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſtudied againſt Atheiſme, and could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get the better of it, at laſt prayed that God would help him in it, and he was clean rid of all his horrid temptations this way, and was as really perſwaded of the truth of unſeen things as of the chair he ſat in.</hi> And many no doubt now alive have found by their own bleſſed experience, that when the moſt rational arguments have not cured their diſtruſtfull thoughts, Prayer hath done it ſpeedily; they have kneeled down <hi>with
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:52563:113"/> the ſpirit of heavineſs,</hi> but did riſe up <hi>cloathed with the garment of praiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> I ſhould have hopes that God had not caſt me off, did he vouchſafe to receive a prayer from me; but this is that which heightneth all my miſeries, that <hi>When I ſpread forth my hands, he hideth his eyes from me; yea, when I make many prayers, he doth not hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a ſad caſe indeed, but no other then what many of the deareſt ſervants of God have complained of: The Spouſe ſo complains, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.5. <hi>I ſought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no anſwer.</hi> So doth the Church, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.44. <hi>Thou haſt covered thy ſelf with a cloud, that our prayers ſhould not paſs through.</hi> But perhaps this was ſome faint Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Nay, it was a moſt vehement Prayer; <hi>When I cry and ſhout, he ſhutteth out my prayer,</hi> verſ. 8. And before theſe, <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 22.1, 2. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? why are thou ſo far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou heareſt not; and in the night-ſeaſon, and am not ſilent.</hi> And before him, <hi>Job</hi> ch. 30. v. 20. <hi>I cry unto thee, and thou doeſt not hear me: I ſtand up, and thou regardeſt me not.</hi> We muſt to avoid the dint of this temptation, know, that it is our duty <hi>to pray alway, and not to faint;</hi> and what
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:52563:113"/> the fruit of that will be, our Saviour hath told us in a whole Parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. The repulſes God either gives or ſeemeth to give unto our Prayers, ſhould onely intend our devotion, and make Faith to gather up its ſtrength: Therefore we ſhall obſerve in Scriptures, that it hath not been unuſual for Chriſtians to plead and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with God, in caſe of deſertion and not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering prayer. <hi>Why art thou ſo far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?</hi> Pſal. 22.1. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.4. <hi>O Lord God of Hoſts, how long wiit thou be angry againſt the prayer of thy people?</hi> Many places there be of the ſame ſtrain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: which pleas and arguings, becauſe they do ſometimes ariſe from that holy becoming boldneſs which is purchaſed for Saints by the Blood of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. but do alſo ſometimes ariſe from a ſinfull ſaucineſs made up of diſcontent and unbelief; therefore I ſhall, to compleat this laſt Direction, ſhew when a deſerted perſon is in a fit frame thus to plead with God, and alſo what are the Topicks from which Faith may argue.</p>
               <p>A man cannot believingly plead and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with God for not anſwering his Prayers, till he be meet to receive that mercy he prayeth for. Whileſt iniquity is regarded, God will eaſily anſwer our pleadings, and make us aſhamed of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:52563:114"/> our expoſtulations. <hi>Wherefore have we faſted, and thou ſeeſt not? Wherefore have we afflicted our ſouls, and thou takeſt no knowledge?</hi> Iſai. 58.3. God eaſily counterpleadeth, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Behold ye faſt for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſſe.</hi> Your faſts end in, and are ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with vexatious ſuits and brawls;<note place="margin">Vid. Gatak, in locum.</note> you miſuſe your ſervants, and deal hardly with your debtors not able to pay you. <hi>Ye ſhall not faſt as ye do this day, to make your voice be heard on high.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <q>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver look to have your faſtings accepted, or your ſuits heard on high, ſo long as ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue theſe courſes of vexation and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> If we muſt not plead till we be meet for mercy, then we muſt never plead; for our hearts being once made meet for mercy, God beſtows mercy, and ſo no need to plead for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Meetneſs doth not conſiſt in <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibili,</hi> but hath its latitude and degrees. God doth not delay to anſwer when he hath brought a man to full fitneſs; but he may and doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times delay when he hath brought him to ſome fitneſs. That alſo may be a full fitneſs for one, that is not a full fitneſs for another; and that a full fitneſs for the ſame man at one time, that is not at another. 'Tis commonly ſaid, and truly,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:52563:114"/> that there are preparatory works to Converſion, but theſe are not alike for degree in all: thoſe that have led orderly civil lives, are uſually by a leſs humiliation fitted for faith, then thoſe whoſe ſins have more ſcandalized Religion: ſo are thoſe who are deſigned for a private life, then they whom God calls to the work of the Miniſtry. That very repentance that would have fitted a man for Aſſurance at firſt, will not fit him to have it renewed, after he hath by any notorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting loſt it. He alſo who is by God deſigned for exemplary ſtrictneſs and eminent mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, doth commonly come by his Aſſurance more hardly then he who was not deſigned to be ſo choice a veſſel. He therefore who lives without the ſenſe of Gods love, though he have waited for it more then they who wait for the morning watch, let him think that God hath ſome gracious end in this diſpenſation, either to humble him afreſh for former ſins, or to cauſe him the more highly to value Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, or to make him a more able experienced comforter of others: yet if he be not conſcious to himſelf of indulging any known ſin, let him not ceaſe to pray that God would reſtore unto him the joy of his ſalvation, nor yet humbly to expoſtulate with God, and enquire wherefore He hides his face from him; for theſe expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:52563:115"/> and pleadings are the ways in which, and means by which God giveth in promiſed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and in and by which our own faith is ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up to lay hold of Chriſt, his Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. We muſt not by our pleadings deſign to make any change in God <hi>(with whom there is not the leaſt variableneſs, or ſhadow of turning,)</hi> but to make a change in our ſelves; our wraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is not to overcome God, but to overcome our own pride and infidelity: yet we are ſaid (Scripture accommodating it ſelf to our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) to awaken God, to prevail over God himſelf, Hoſ. 12.4. <hi>He prevailed over the Angel, he wept, and made ſupplication.</hi> By the Angel, almoſt every one now thinks we are to underſtand the <hi>Angel of the Covenant,</hi> God bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Let us ſee what it is from which we may ſo argue with God, as to have power with him, and prevail.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We may argue with him from all the names (ſuitable to our condition) by which he hath called himſelf in Scripture.</hi> Many comfortable names God proclaimes himſelf by, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. look what it is that beſt hits our condition, by that we may plead with God. So we find <hi>Moſes</hi> to have done, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.17, 18, 19. <hi>And now I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as thou haſt ſpoken. The Lord is long
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:52563:115"/> ſuffering, and of great mercy, forgiviag iniquity and tranſgreſsion. Pardon, I pray thee, the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of this people, according to the greatneſs of thy mercies.</hi> Scarcely can any deſerted perſons condition be clothed with ſuch circumſtances, as that he may not be able to relieve himſelf, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with God by ſome one of thoſe ſeven names by which his good affection to repenting ſinners is ſet out: they are ſeven skirts by the which he would have us to lay hold of him, and not let him go till he hath bleſſed us. In Scripture alſo he makes himſelf known by the name of <hi>Father,</hi> by that name the Church argueth with him, Iſa. 63.16. <hi>Doubtleſs thou art our Father.</hi> This was the hinge on which the Prodigals Faith did turn, <hi>I will go to my Father, and ſay, Father. Dulce nomen patris:</hi> Let every deſerted ſoul plead it with God. Thou art my Father; and can a Father ſhut his armes againſt a ſon, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly indeed diſobedient, but now intreating mercy with tears, reſolving to redeem the loſs of former, with improvement of the time to come? He that ſhall thus with true remorſe and hearty grief beſpeak God, ſhall not long be without the <hi>beſt robes, the ring, and the ſhoes,</hi> without the moſt ſignal tokens of fatherly love.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> If I durſt call God Father, then I were well enough, but this is my miſery, that I have
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:52563:116"/> loſt all that which ſometimes made me to think he was my father, and afforded me ſome bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in my acceſſes to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> If I ſhould for once gratifie thee in thy hard thoughts concerning thy ſelf, yet thou canſt not deny but that God is thy Father on a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon account, as a Creator. Plead that rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for it will go a great way with God, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we be alſo within the pale of his Church, Iſa. 64.8, 9. <hi>But now, O Lord, thou art our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we are the clay, thou art the Potter, we are all the work of thy hands. Be not wroth very ſore, O Lord, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, ſee, we beſeech thee, we are all thy people.</hi> An argument alſo uſed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.8. <hi>Job</hi> 10.8, 9. In all the places there is an alluſion to Gods framing mans body at firſt, but perhaps ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more is aimed at, <hi>viz.</hi> that they had been by God not onely formed and faſhioned in the womb, but alſo formed and faſhioned into a Church, taken into Covenant, and ſo made a peculiar people, doubtleſs there is ſomething to be made of this, that we are called by Gods Name, and that we are <hi>the ſons of his handmaid,</hi> born in his houſe; ſome weight this nail will bear; if we hang all our veſſels on it, then it muſt needs break.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The very extremity of our condition is a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:52563:116"/> very effectual plea with God:</hi> he uſeth it as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to himſelf, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.17. <hi>I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for ever, neither will I be alway wroth, for the ſpirit ſhould fail before me, and the ſouls which I have made.</hi> While no temptation hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen us but what is common, God counts not himſelf ſo much concerned to regard us; but when once we are tempted with ſuch malice as we ſhall not long be able to bear, God will then ſoon either reſtrain, or refrain his anger: When therefore our ſpiritual troubles are come to a true, and not onely an imaginary extremity, let us plead that with God: ſo ſeems <hi>Heman</hi> to do, Pſal. 88.14, 15. <hi>Lord why hideſt thou thy face from me? I am afflicted and ready to die; from my youth up, whilſt I ſuffer thy terrors, I am di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted.</hi> God may ſuffer ſoul-trouble to end in diſtraction, and it hath ſometime ſo ended; but this is his ſtrange work, and it will not diſpleaſe him that any in whom his arrows do ſtick ſhould pray to have them pulled out, leſt they ſhould drink up their ſpirits, yea, leſt the horror of them ſhould deprive them of ſenſe and reaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Deſerted Souls may remember God of his former gracious dealings with them. The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Jews cried aloud to Pilate, deſiring him to do as he had ever done unto them,</hi> Mark 15.8. They thought it would be unworthy of a man in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:52563:117"/> authority to leave off to do acts of grace; yet men ſometimes think they are not engaged to do more, becauſe they have already done ſo much. But God doth do good, that he may do good; his former loving kindneſſes may be pleaded with him as arguments to move him to renew his mercies. Can any one that is diſtreſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the time when God did wipe off the tears from his eyes, and bid him be of good chear becauſe his ſins were forgiven him? thence let his faith plead as doth the Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.15. <hi>Where is thy zeal, and thy ſtrength, the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thy bowels, and of thy mercies towards me? are they reſtrained?</hi> That tender affection and ability to do me good, of which I had formerly ſo many evident ſigns, and conſpicuous proofs; how come I now to hear nothing of it? How comes it about that thoſe breaſts (ſo ſome read, and not bowels) of conſolation that I was wont to ſuck at ſo freely till I was ſatisfied, are now quite put up, though I need them more then ever I did? And to ſtrengthen our faith yet more, we may mind God that he hath done greater things for us then that we ask; for he hath given us his Son to die for us when we were enemies; and will he not now give us the fruits of his ſuffering? Did he not ſtick at letting his onely begotten pay the dear price for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:52563:117"/> and will he think much to let us onely have our ſhare in it?</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>We may in deſertion plead our own readineſs to remit unto others their offences againſt us.</hi> This plea Chriſt (ſuppoſing us to lift up pure hands, void of wrath) hath put into our mouths in that moſt compleat form of Prayer, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Forgive us our ſins; for we alſo forgive every one that is indebted to us.</hi> Can we who have a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in us luſting to envy, revenge, fury, bring our hearts to forgive our offending brethren to ſeventy times ſeven, and wilt not thou, O God, who challengeſt us to ſhew <hi>any God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſgreſsion of the remnant of his heritage,</hi> Mic. 7.18. blot out our ſins as a miſt, and our iniquities as a thick cloud.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>We may alſo plead the compaſsion and prayers of others for us.</hi> Thus, Do all the Lords Miniſters bowels yern towards me? and ſhall Gods bowels be reſtrained towards me? Do they declare themſelves ready to looſe all my ſins, and ſhall God retain them? Will the Stewards ſhew pity, and will the Lord who gave them their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhew none? It is lawful to plead our own Prayers, much more the Prayers of others, Pſal. 80.4. <hi>O Lord God of Hoſts, how long wilt thou be angry againſt the prayers of thy people?</hi> If
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52563:118"/> thine anger be kindled againſt me, yet ſith all the Church prayeth for me without ceaſing, wilt thou not accept her? Didſt thou ever ſay to the whole houſe of <hi>Jacob, Seek ye my face in vain?</hi> Papiſts ſpeak much of a treaſure of the Church made up of the ſatisfactions purchaſed by the death of Chriſt, and of the Paſsions of the Saints, who in the days of their fleſh ſuffered more then their ſins required; the ſufferings and ſatisfactions of theſe Saints may be applied to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſay they, and Church Officers have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to diſpenſe them, and grant indulgences. Such a treaſure we all reject with abhorrence, but yet according to the Creed, we acknowledg <hi>a communion of Saints,</hi> conſiſting in the mutual help and aſsiſtance of one another by prayer. Doubtleſs it may ſomewhat quiet and ſtay our troubleſome ſpirits, to call to remembrance, that when we dare ſcarce ſpeak for our ſelves, there are of our fellow Chriſtians that are crying for us, ſome making particular mention of us, (a favour often deſired by St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 15.30. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.18, 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 4 3. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1, 2.) others mentioning us as members of the ſame body with themſelves, known to God, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to themſelves.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>We may plead the ill uſe like to be made of our deſertions by others, whether they be good, or
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52563:118"/> bad.</hi> This Plea, if we be ſincere in it, is like to be very effectual, becauſe it ariſeth from a love to Religion, a fear leſt it ſhould ſuffer in our ſufferings. God can ſo order it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth, that his ſervants ſoul-ſtraights do benefit thoſe without, and thoſe within. When the Spouſe had cauſed her beloved to withdraw, <hi>He put in his hand by the hole of the door, and her bowels were moved for him,</hi> Cant. 5.4. ſhe ſtarts and follows after him, and enquires of all ſhe met concerning him. Now what was the effect of this? The Daughters of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ask <hi>ver.</hi> 9. <hi>What is thy beloved more then another beloved, that thou doſt ſo charge us?</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 6.1. enquire <hi>whither he is gone? whither turned aſide, that they might ſeek him with the ſpouſe?</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in reaſon one would think this ſhould be the language of by-ſtanders: If a loſt Chriſt be ſo precious, what is an enjoyed Chriſt? If a frowning Saviour be ſo deſireable, what is a ſmiling Saviour? But oh how ſeldom is it ſo? Do we not rather obſerve that hereby,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The good are much diſcouraged; apt they be to <hi>faint at thoſe tribulations which do befall others, though for their ſakes,</hi> Epheſ. 3.13. How much more for thoſe tribulations that ſeem brought on their fellow Chriſtians by Gods own immediate hand? In this caſe there is room for
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:52563:119"/> that ingeminated plea of <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 69.6. <hi>Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord, be aſhamed for my ſake: let not thoſe that ſeek thee be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded for my ſake, O God of Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The bad are much hardned and made to rejoyce. Hence they ſay, in a ſenſe quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Solomons</hi> ſenſe, <hi>He that increaſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, increaſeth ſorrow;</hi> and reſolve to get no more Religion then what they can eaſily maſter, and never to put Faith or any other grace on the trial: yea, hence they riſe to helliſh and moſt accurſed inſultations, Where is now your God? your Religion. From this Topick <hi>David</hi> doth often argue in his <hi>Pſalms,</hi> Pſal. 27.11. <hi>Lead me in a plain path</hi> (wherein I may not ſcandalize my ſelf) <hi>becauſe of mine enemies.</hi> 38.16. I ſaid, <hi>Hear me, leſt otherwiſe they ſhould rejoyce over me, and magnifie themſelves againſt me when my foot ſlippeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Double to theſe are the pleas proper to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted ſouls, that may be picked out of the Book of <hi>Pſalms;</hi> but I forbear to gather them together, commending the Book it ſelf, as the beſt Directory to furniſh thoſe who are in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with fit praying-matter: onely let them be ſure that they be ſincere, uſing <hi>Davids</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with <hi>Davids</hi> heart, <hi>i. e.</hi> humbly, believing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, charging their ſouls to wait on God; ſo <hi>He
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:52563:119"/> that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry:</hi> So ſhall he who now ſtands as an Enemy, or as a Stranger, ſay, <hi>Is</hi> Ephraim <hi>my dear ſon? is he a pleaſant child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill: Therefore my bowels are troubled for him I will have mercy on him; ſo ſhall the wilderneſs and the ſolitary place be glad, and the deſart rejoyce and bloſſom as the roſe, bloſſom abundantly, and rejoyce with joy and ſinging. The ranſomed of Lord ſhall return and come to</hi> Zion <hi>with ſongs, and everlaſting joy, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their heads; they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſſe, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Bleſſed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforteth us in all our tribulation. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. Through the ſmalneſs of their graces. Converſion more diſcernable at the firſt Plantation of the Goſpel then now. Some Objections anſwered, <hi>p.</hi> 113. to 116. 2. Becauſe they ſeek it not with diligence enough: the caſe of poor Chriſtians conſidered, <hi>p.</hi> 117, 118, 119. 3. Becauſe of their ignorance and errours about the Terms and Conditions of the Covenant of Grace; about knowing the time of Converſion; about the way of working of Aſſurance, and the nature of Aſſurance, <hi>p.</hi> 120. to 123. 4. Becauſe they keep the Devils counſel, and bury their doubts in their own boſomes, <hi>p.</hi> 123, 124, 125. 5. Becauſe they joyn themſelves to unmeet company. Five ſorts of people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet to be aſſociated with by perſons troubled in ſpirit, <hi>p.</hi> 125, 126, 127. 6. Becauſe they perverſly cavil and diſpute againſt that which ſhould comfort them, <hi>p.</hi> 127. to 130. 7. Becauſe they give way to groundleſs ſcruples in reference to the uſe of Gods Ordinances, and their own callings, <hi>p.</hi> 130, 131, 132. 8. Becauſe they do not heartily enough oppoſe ſome unmortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed luſts, <hi>p.</hi> 133, 134.</item>
